## BREAD IS SOLD OUT

What is B.R.E.A.D.? It's a grant and fundraising experiment. It's a put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is for people who want to see more public art in Stockton. 

BREAD stands for Backing Resources for Emerging Artists Democratically (B.R.E.A.D) and it is our first fundraiser dinner party. Think Shark Tank, but anti-capitalist, democratic, and with a goal of supporting the arts community in Stockton.

**SEPT. 23** | **6PM-9PM** | **STOCKTON**

Come break BREAD with us. The proceeds from ticket sales are used to fund creative projects that feed Stockton arts and culture, as well as Placeholder Magazine’s operations.

Attendees will have a gastronomical experience by LoMade, enjoy refreshments, experience entertainment, and hear presentations from three finalists.

>One ticket = one vote. You will pick the project you support.

Through this democratic system, patrons of the arts will be directly involved in supporting the arts community. We hope to provide a $1000 grant for an original community-based project, helping the proposal become a reality.
