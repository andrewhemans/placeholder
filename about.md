Placeholder Magazine is the independent critical voice covering contemporary arts, culture, and literature. We are a Central Valley-based not-for-profit organization that encourages public appreciation of and participation in the arts, providing an accessible forum for diverse voices, and empower youth through participation. We do so in print, online, and through community outreach.

Placeholder Magazine began in the summer of 2013 with a handful of friends who tried to recognize the diversity and talent of Stocktonâ€™s contemporary art scene. The organization is all-volunteer run and is deeply rooted with the identity of the Central Valley. Our range of contributors varies greatly and emphasizes intergenerationality, varying forms of craft and experience, and differing identities, lifestyles and perspectives.
