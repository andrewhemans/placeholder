Placeholder Magazine is an independent critical voice covering contemporary arts, culture, and literature. We are a Central Valley based non-profit arts organization led entirely by volunteers. Through print and digital mediums, we provide an accessible forum for diverse voices as well as energize and activate young leaders through artistic practice, collaborative and collective decision making, and community-based projects locally and beyond.

Placeholder began in the summer of 2013 with a handful of friends who were in the midst of a city-wide emergence of creative response to Stockton's unique and painful challenges as a city, recognizing the immense diversity, talent and resilience in the arts community. Its roots run deep in the Central Valley, inspired by art shows tacked to walls and hung on wire, bands playing in corners of abandoned strip malls and defunct industrial spaces. Our range of contributors spans multiple generations and cultures, varying forms of craft, experience, differing identities, lifestyles and perspectives. Through navigating a combination of hometown love (holding down our place and acknowledging what it is, has been, and what could be) and the yearning for new and unfamiliar experiences/ideas, our collective embodies a dual definition for the word: placeholder.
