## Call for Proposals for B.R.E.A.D.

We are thrilled to announce an open call for project proposals for B.R.E.A.D., Backing Resources for Emerging Artists Democratically. B.R.E.A.D. is a fundraiser dinner party in which the great portion of the ticket sales will be used as a grant to fund a creative project in Stockton. 
 
**Do you have an innovative idea for a project that will benefit the arts community of the Central Valley? We invite you to participate in this opportunity to get $1000.00 in funding!**

The artists or collectives whose ideas have greater creative innovation, community focus, and organizational competency will be invited to present their projects at the event on September 30th, where the attendees will vote for their favorite. Proposals can include, but are not limited to: workshops, public art, artists’ residencies, and curated shows. The project with the majority of votes will get funded.  

## About us:
