**<span style="color: #222222; text-decoration: underline;">The Love Story</span>**

<div style="color: #222222;">
  This once understood gesture of affection<br /> Ripples then fades<br /> On silver mirrors<br /> What used to be like crashing waves<br /> Clear<br /> But now holding you is like holding<br /> Smoke in fog<br /> No need for dialog<br /> Don&#8217;t know where I am or<br /> Who you are<br /> Capabilities far and long gone<br /> With anxiety as the weather<br /> I&#8217;ve grown so fond<br /> Preserved in a glass bubble<br /> With memories as a pond<br /> Ill roll on the thin ice<br /> Your eyes despise my lies<br /> Like a vice they pulverize<br /> The new me<br /> And what I used to be<br /> The duet of personalities crushed<br /> Like two flies<br /> They belonged to no worth<br /> Lived in pigsties<br /> Begged and borrowed since birth<br /> Now my main concern<br /> Is if there more to learn<br /> Habitual torrents plague recent thoughts<br /> Like how gasoline on the floor burns<br /> Like how a swamp rots<br /> Then time<br /> Stops<br /> Dampened envisions<br /> Of what I can&#8217;t see<br /> Trapped decisions<br /> Wither slowly<br /> Suicidal incisions<br /> Set slaves free<br /> Finality to what they ever could be<br /> With qualities of passion in my heart<br /> I was driven<br /> But I failed with what I was given<br /> Flying pigs and cancer-less ciggs<br /> Was what I believed in<br /> I always played your hopeless romantic<br /> Full speed against the traffic<br /> Opposite the flow<br /> My actions in a panic<br /> I lost it so<br /> I became witness<br /> To my own pandemic<br /> Of course I embellished my world<br /> With fantasy<br /> Much like the vastness of the sea<br /> Grown accustomed<br /> And I wouldn&#8217;t put it past me<br /> If I went back to the way things used to be<br /> Take a second<br /> Glance<br /> My actions merit nothing worthy<br /> Of a second chance<br /> But if one does simply &#8220;fall in love&#8221;<br /> Then I was the tight-rope-walker<br /> Who slipped and fell<br /> With no net<br /> So the tickets would sell<br /> These lips cemented to yours<br /> Have such a love story to tell<br /> But the words and memories<br /> Were drowned in dry wells<br /> The love story became<br /> The most vivid depiction of<br /> Hell

  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Glass Eye</span></strong>
</div>

<div style="color: #222222;">
  So begins the blowing of a glass eye.The furnace blindly burning bubbles and melting sand<br /> from underneath our withered troubles.<br /> So sudden as to judge outcomes<br /> of that which is forming for me.<br /> Humble turning of molten globs<br /> like stars<br /> on the ends of rods shoved<br /> deeply into campfires;we started to view things like Gods.But only the fire really knows.Those red lit flickers<br /> lick glass atmospheres with tongues split<br /> for Agony&#8217;s perfection.<br /> Sporadic crackles laugh back at me<br /> from Hellish pits,<br /> and their hungry voices<br /> stick on my complexion.Still that sand suffers and cradles itself.<br /> Still my hand flutters across that axis<br /> until this glass melts.Soon the whites of the glass eye will glow brightly,<br /> but for now the flame beckons<br /> back my eye<br /> and belches it&#8217;s self wealth.</p>

  <p>
    This creation yelps and hisses in specifics<br /> to the damage being dealt, so very<br /> Harmoniously.
  </p>

  <p>
    If only angels could sing songs for the burnt and lonely,<br /> and their ashes could collapse<br /> in patches of passion.
  </p>

  <p>
    They&#8217;d paint the earth ever so<br /> Gloriously.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eye can see the Eye on the stem.<br /> I can see the I that holds them.<br /> I remember Eyes so well<br /> that I memorized<br /> what Eye looked back then.
  </p>

  <p>
    We looked at one another like old blind friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    So my skin caved in to the charred<br /> heat of thousands of degrees and I ripped<br /> my molten eye from Damnation.<br /> I inflated it like a lung being forced to breathe.<br /> It&#8217;s plasticity let it gasp and stretch<br /> in wretched suggestion.
  </p>

  <p>
    So Vast it&#8217;s intentions Grew.

    <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BONFIRE</span></strong>
  </p>

  <div>
    <p>
      My eyes gazed into the embers of the whistling and popping fire for so long that I forgot the name that burdened me.

      A trance danced its way into the depths of memory and blinded it.<br /> Reminded not of the past, for once, as it was scorched by smoke choking endeavors of late nights with friends.<br /> The darkness of Stockton delta after sundown seemed locked and melted with orange flickers of warmth.<br /> The deep recesses of my trials got the dials turned down a bit, and they too, were melted by those orange flickers of warmth.<br /> A soft veil draped over the night and caressed me with a loving embrace like a mother I have only met a few times before.<br /> The fire hissed every now-and-again.<br /> And so did the aerosol spray paint in the distance as it seemed fit for a few friends to color the night.<br /> Still, I stare whilst I sip simplicity from sudsy cheap Pabst.<br /> After so much of that, no one should steep themselves in the past.<br /> A soft clammour from conversations surrounding a bonfire hummed like the millions of West Nile vessels surrounding us.<br /> A soft hum indeed.<br /> Each voice its&#8217; own vessel for the inspired.<br /> I would hum as well.<br /> Dipping in and out of commonality between people like a mesmerizing dance.<br /> All the while a fire kept everyone visible and warm.<br /> By chance, a rope hung from age old rafters and offered to have itself made into a swing.<br /> Of course we would have this offering.<br /> A brave few would be pushed, and fly blindly in-between the harmony of orange luminescence, so violently, that their heads would start to spin.<br /> This commenced laughter, and the fire laughed as well as it crackled gently in the background.

  Nichola Grgurevic is an oddly quiet child that was born in Santa Clara in &#8217;91. Manically moving all over the bay area for 8 years; he eventually landed in Stockton.<br /> During high school at Lincoln, he wasn&#8217;t so quite anymore and began writing poetry then yelling it at people through microphones. He still occasionally writes poetry, but likes to yell at people through microphones more. Nicholas and Stockton argue from time-to-time, and even leave each other when it gets really bad. They usually find each other after awhile apart. It&#8217;s a love-hate thing.
