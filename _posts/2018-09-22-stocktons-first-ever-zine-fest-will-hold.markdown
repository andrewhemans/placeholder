What is a zine?? Zines are DIY. They come in all types, sizes, and can be about anything or everything. There are no rules; no HTML, drag-and-drop websites, there is no limit to what you can create, and no one to tell you that you canâ€™t. The best part is anyone can make one.   

Yes, we have blogs and vlogs and we tend to think of the web as a place for freedom, but with zines, authors control every aspect, from the design to the distribution. In addition, producing zines can offer an unexpected respite from the scrutiny on the internet, which can be as oppressive as it is liberating.  

One could say that zines are almost necessary alternatives to the internet.   

>On October 13, Stockton will host its first-ever Zine Fest.  

Zine festivals are becoming more popular, with [San Francisco](www.sfzinefest.org/), [East Bay](https://www.ebabzfest.com), [San Jose](https://www.facebook.com/sbDIYzc/), and most recently [Sacramento](http://www.vergeart.com/attend/sacramento-zine-fest/)hosting yearly gatherings for this DIY hobby.

This Summer, Placeholder Magazine and Tuleburg Press [hosted a series](https://www.facebook.com/events/478056055970112/) of free workshops for youth and adults that taught the history and process of zine-making. These free workshops held space for participants to create their own zine which will be on display at Stockton Zine Fest.  

The Stockton Zine Fest and workshops are partially funded by Stockton Arts Commission and the California Arts Council and will be part of [Stockton Arts Week](https://www.visitstockton.org/events/stockton-arts-week-stockton-zine-fest/) which occurs every year and highlights the vibrant art and culture Stockton.
