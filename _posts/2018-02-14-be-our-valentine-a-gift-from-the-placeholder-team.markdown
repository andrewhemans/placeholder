Dear [your name here],

Roses are red.  
Violets are blue.  
Placeholder cares,  
So we made a playlist for you.  
   
Okay, so we may not be the best poets, but that’s not why we are here. Whether you are romantically involved, recovering from a breakup, or just want to celebrate with your friends (Galentine’s, anyone?), we’re here for you. Placeholder members have teamed up to create a playlist full of their favorite love-related songs. Pick your favorites, or listen to them all — there’s something for everyone.  
   
   
Yours Truly,  
   
The Placeholder Crew  
   
P.S. Are there any others you would add? Let us know, and your choice may be featured in our next playlist. <3
