Growing up in Lodi, California, afforded Justin Marsh an opportunity to become acquainted with disintegration. Through his familiarity with rusting landscapes and his “grappling with trauma at a young age, [he] found that the development of [his] work is informed by characteristics of failure and collapse.”

Justin’s work skirts the line between photorealism and surrealism. His warm, murky tones animate forgotten relics in a way that realizes their place and value on this earth. He plucks objects from reality and blends them in his memory-drenched visions, giving them a new life that celebrates their worth. Justin “intend[s] to capture loss and imbue it with...its inherent beauty.”

To put yourself in front of these works, visit [Axis Gallery](http://axisgallery.org/) in Sacramento through June 25th. If you prefer to do that with wine in your hand, attend the reception on Saturday, June 10th from 6-9pm. Looking forward, Justin is researching and working on his next project, *The Four Humors*, which he will showcase at Axis Gallery in 2018.
