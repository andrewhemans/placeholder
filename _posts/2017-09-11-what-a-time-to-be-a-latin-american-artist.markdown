James Cuno, art historian and curator of the Getty Museum, wrote this quote in reference to people visiting museums after the September 11, 2001 attacks:  
  
*“I’d like to think that by providing and preserving examples of beauty, museums foster a greater sense of caring in the world and urge their visitors to undergo a radical decentering before the work of art.”*  
  
I believe Latin American artists accomplish what Cuno is referring to by illustrating the Latin American experience in the United States through artistic mediums.  
  
The identity politics war going on in the U.S., a war that often feels *ajena* (poorly translated by Google as “foreign” but not quite the same), has taken over our mental and emotional environment. Latin American people have struggled for survival, human rights, and fair representation in countless environments, including the arts. The announcement of the end of DACA ([Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/daca-trump-congress/index.html)) has been the last straw in a mount of injustice, yet in a moment of clarity I noticed many West Coast art institutions had been curating shows that represent people of Latin American heritage. We are facing a terrifying era, and I hope we can sense that beauty and caring for the world in the arts being made by our own kind.  
Below are some relatable exhibitions you can visit in California for all those searching for a sublime moment in desperate times:
