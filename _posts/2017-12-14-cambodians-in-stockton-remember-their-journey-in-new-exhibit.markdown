During a fundraiser this past September, I got to talking with a reporter from Stockton’s largest newspaper. “Stockton is a majority-minority community” I said, with a sense of pride. After all, the city's population of people of color has increased [from 30% to nearly 65% within the past 30 years](http://nationalequityatlas.org/data-summaries/Stockton,_CA_Metro_Area/). <br>

“Stockton is a plurality, not a majority-minority community,” the reporter replied. I think we both had too much to drink, given that a community can be both, but one thing is for certain: Stockton is diverse.

The sold-out fundraiser event was Backing Resources for Emerging Artists Democratically (BREAD), a [mini-grant program](http://www.placeholdermag.com/bread) hosted by Placeholder Magazine, where the ticket sales ($1,000) went to a community arts project presented by artists or organizations. This year’s winner was [*The Cambodian Experience: Our Journey to America Exhibit*](https://www.facebook.com/events/1427384197300264/).

*Pictured are the candidates for B.R.E.A.D.; "The Cambodian Experience" was awarded the $1,000 prize and received additional funding from The Stockton Arts Commission and UC Berkeley.*

*The Cambodian Experience* is an exhibit put on by United Cambodian American Network (UCAN), and its purpose is to raise awareness, educate, and revive Cambodian-American history and culture. Through multiple galleries, the exhibit will showcase the cultural music, dance, and theater forms of the Cambodian people. A gallery will be dedicated to the people whose lives were lost in the Cambodian Genocide. 

In addition, *The Cambodian Experience* highlights the great influx of Cambodian refugees who arrived to the United States due to the mass genocide that took place in Cambodia between 1975-1979. Many of which found a home in Stockton. Today there are over [10,000 Cambodians living in Stockton](http://khmersalem.blogspot.com/2013/06/what-us-city-has-most-khmer.html). 

**"*The Cambodian Experience: Our Journey to America*" exhibit is FREE.** The event opens on December 16th at the San Joaquin County Office of Education, and will run until December 22nd.
