Brandon Getty is a photojournalist that has been featured in Placeholder before, most known for his project MAPS TO STOCKTON, exploring &#8216;residential and urban space&#8217; in Stockton, California. The first volume of photographs from that series has been made tangible into books he is selling for $10 each! From Getty himself:

&#8220;To all of my friends,
