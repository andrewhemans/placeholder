>“He really had been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude.” 
― Gabriel García Márquez, _One Hundred Years of Solitude._

In April of 2014 I was in my dark apartment in Midtown Sacramento crying. I had walked home from my internship at an art gallery, I had closed down the place in a stupor. I walked home feeling numb and didn’t feel tears running down my cheek until I turned on G street, G. for Gabriel. One of my childhood heros had died. 

When I arrived to the United States at the age of 15 I was bored out of my mind. I moved with my immediate family from the city of Aguascalientes Mex., to southside Stockton, by Main street, just a few blocks away from the Fair Oaks Library. That library was my only consolation to feeling completely misplaced, intimidated, and trapped in this country, new to me at the time. I had read Gabriel García Márquez’ One Hundred Years of Solitude already, but that year, away from my home, I devoured all his other novels available at Fair Oaks. Mexico had been the author’s refuge in the 1960’s and it inspired him to start writing his most acclaimed novel, and in 2005 he was my refuge. 

I am sure I am not the only one person who felt this way, but magical realism shaped the way I saw the world as a young teenager, and subconsciously I was also very influenced by García Márquez’ criticism on imperialism. Although I was surprised that his collection ended up in an american institution, I was glad to hear that this was in The University of Texas, and that it is being made available to the [public online here](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll51/). The collection includes among other things, ten manuscripts, fourty photo albums, twenty scrapbooks, five computers, and tons of correspondence.

_Gabriel[ García Márquez and Juan Rulfo](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll73/id/17879/rec/5), 1983_

After digging around the online archive I picked a few of my favorite things including this photograph of García Márquez and Juan Rulfo, who wrote Pedro Paramo, another classic I feel in love with in my early teenage years, alongside Isabel Allende and Carlos Fuentes’ works. Below is one out of many pictures of the author with Fidel Castro. They met in 1959 and developed a friendship when Castro mentioned a correction on a speed boat calculation in one of his books, which propelled the author to send his manuscripts to be [copy edited by Castro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fzxHQPB1WM).

Below is a section of Vivir Para Contarla, in which Fidel Castro is mentioned. I have not yet finished this book, the authors autobiography, but it is available in audio in multiple online platforms.

Here is the page of a printing proof of Cien años de Soledad where Remedios la bella, my favorite character, is talked about.

One of the best thoughts I had while searching the collection was the hope that Gabriel García Márquez continues to influence young and old latin american readers to have that view of the surreal and real, and to create artistic identities to share with one another. This inspiration is especially while living in the politically tumultuous times of today, which can definitely be compared to the instability of many central and south american countries during the 60’s that caused authors like García Márquez to leave their homelands.
