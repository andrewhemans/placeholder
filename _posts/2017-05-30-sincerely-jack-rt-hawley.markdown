<u>Loose</u><br>
To be scared to say what I wanna say<br> 
We're on that warming griddle<br>
Just in the midst<br>
Of those waiting ruby flames to lick every one of us<br>
We're warming<br>
Warming fast<br>
Or slow<br>
And sow these seeds of resentment<br>
Towards myself towards these others I've felt<br>
That could have been my lovers and loyal friends<br>
But when we meet this velvet end<br>
Like the top of one of those tables<br>
You know<br>
The one you see in your grandmother's place.<br>
Was made in a time with different tastes and feels and thoughts<br>
In a moment where people seemed bigger and more foundational within this world and the next<br>
Like layers of bricks and mortar<br>
One held the other in a strong gravelly embrace<br>
Now though<br>
I don't know what happened to that communal bricklaying<br>
Might have been taken away from you or I<br>
Or we might have a fresh attempt at in our palms<br>
To lay bricks of different<br>
Colours<br>
Sizes<br> 
Feels<br>
Textures<br>
Material<br>
Some would say<br>
'What a shit wall, how'd that stand boy?'<br>
But this the experiment I'd hold true to myself and I'd show to others<br>
Each brick may sag or sink or shift<br>
Each will sag into another<br>
Sink only to be lifted up<br> 
Shift so others can keep that void filled<br>
Use of this wall has to portray our wild relationship too<br>
So it can't block<br>
Or evict<br>
Or isolate man<br>
We'll make a home from it,<br> 
One blessed by welcoming fellows<br>
Who'll take others and love any<br> 
They will be the shields of many.<br>

<br>
<u>Vital news</u><br>
If you want to play life like a fiddle<br> 
then throw out the fiddle<br>
and buy a grand piano<br>

<br>
<u>Untamed</u><br>
my hair<br>
it’s coarse, rough, always in bristles<br>
Why should I care<br>
But how did these sweet birds<br>
come to swallow those hard whistles<br>

<br>
<u>Staying Far away for Obvious and Not so Obvious reasons</u><br>
To whom<br>
and whom<br>
should I make it out to?<br>
you wrote down an address<br>
However just like the rest<br>
you never gave me a picture of<br> 
the last sight you saw<br>
when in dreary Ohio<br>
Or in crisply starched New England.<br>
You never gave me that lava-like kindness you felt in Vera Cruz<br>
Or that warmth on the sides of your neck in Berlin<br>
I am or we are<br>
Dishearten to hear the news<br>
the one you already knew<br>
back when you were in homeschool<br> 
with that alcoholic father<br>
who only passed, he threw, the baton to mother.<br> 
You knew more then the next<br>
but you let it slap from your sides<br> 
Only to lead to a new wild game of chutes and slides<br>
and slides<br> 
and sliding<br> 
into my life<br>
That is exactly what you did<br>
For the best of two futures you left that other to see<br>
that you needed me<br>
And now<br>
from this point on<br>
Who should I make it out to son?<br>
