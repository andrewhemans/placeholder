"Almost Live" is a bi-monthly series of bedroom performances by Wizard Apprentice. Every 2nd and 4th Sundays.

Wizard Apprentice is a singer-songwriter, performance artist, electronic music producer, motion graphics artist, introvert and [self proclaimed] weirdo. She was based in the Bay Area and recently made her home in Sacramento. Many of her projects are related to “battling an overwhelming world,” personal and emotional self-analysis and growth, and intimately interpreting and reacting to the age of social media and the internet. Her work consists on live and video performances and video series.
