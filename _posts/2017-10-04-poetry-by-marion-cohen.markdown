**Great Fear of Death**

I cannot believe my body won’t mind being cremated, and then ashes, scattered or not,<br>
Cannot believe my body won’t feel it, won’t have a mind and a con-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ciousness to go with it.<br>
And I wonder whether, on my deathbed, I’ll think about that; I hope I don’t.<br>
I imagine I’ll be in a hospital, having what’s known as a peaceful, painless dying;<br>
Everyone doing their best for my body — morphine or whatever, maybe massaging<br>
And loving, even if none of them are my loved or loving ones.<br>
I hope I don’t think for even a smidgen that all that very best for my body will, once<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dying has become death, turn into the very worst;<br>
I cannot believe the sheet over my face won’t suffocate,<br>
Nor the wheeling of me out of the room won’t frighten<br>
Nor the rest of it<br>
The rest of it;<br>
Again, I hope, on my deathbed, I forget about all that.<br>
I’m not forgetting now but I hope I forget later
Hope I forget lat*est*<br>
My very latest of all.<br>
<br>
<br>

**Mousetraps Circa 1940’s**

Sometimes my parents heard mice scurrying about in the attic.<br>
They set traps, the old-fashioned kind — the kind that snap on their tails.<br>
Whenever one of them worked, my father would put the whole kit-‘n’-caboodle in a<br>
paper bag and head for the fields.<br>
Once he took me with him. I watched him open the bag and then the trap.<br>
The mouse scampered out among the wildflowers.<br>
“’Bye, little mousie,” my father crooned. “Bye bye, mousie.”<br>
The straight line that the mouse scampered along got longer and longer.<br>
I guessed it knew where it was going.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Bangles**

Ample, firm, pudgy, dramatic<br>
and visible from any distance.<br>
They’re the only bracelets I wear.<br>

Lately, though, there’s been a problem:<br>
They keep touching some part of my arm.<br>
They make that part feel annoyed.<br>

And if I raise my arm,<br>
keep it vertical,<br>
they touch that entire cross-section.<br>

If I lower my arm (upside-down vertical)<br>
they sit on my hand like water.<br>
They won’t leave my hand alone.<br>

They make my arm tired.<br>
They’ll give it gangrene.<br>
There’s no good position for that arm.<br>

But that’s only lately.<br>
Am I getting too old for bangles?<br>
Do I have to start wearing those twiddly, weak, weightless, insipid, museum-type<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bracelets?<br>

The kind you can barely see?<br>
The kind you can barely touch?<br>
