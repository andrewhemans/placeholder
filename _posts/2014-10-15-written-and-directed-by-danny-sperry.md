  <strong>Brine Leak</strong>

<span style="color: #808080;">&#8220;The following is a segment of the script to a movie called Brine Leak.  It can be seen on <a style="color: #808080;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G6HLx6ZUI0">YouTube</a>.   This movie was filmed in Stockton at Oak Park Ice Arena about six years ago.  Whenever I re-watch it I think about the old days, and about how fun it was to make.  I also think about how much better we could make it now.  If anyone wants to be involved I&#8217;ve officially decided to remake it so email me at <a style="color: #808080;" href="mailto:Steeproof@gmail.com">Steeproof@gmail.com</a>.&#8221;</span>

Walden charges into the office where he finds his brother Wayne face down at the desk.  He appears infected or possibly even dead.

&nbsp;

Walden: &#8220;WAYNE!!&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;Whats going on?&#8221;

Walden:  &#8220;Are you infected!?&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;No&#8230; I&#8217;m just sleeping.&#8221;

Walden:  &#8220;Come on we gotta go!&#8221;

&nbsp;

Wayne is still half asleep and completely unaware of the zombie attack.

&nbsp;

Wayne:  &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221;

Walden:  &#8220;Are there any guns here?&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;Uhh yeah, there&#8217;s one by the register.

Walden:  &#8220;Go get it!&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;Why?  Are we being robbed dude?&#8221;

Walden: &#8220;No.&#8221;

&nbsp;

They enter the cashiers room to grab the gun as Walden informs his brother that the rink is being overrun by Brine infected zombies.  Realizing they are surrounded they head for the roof.

&nbsp;

Wayne:  &#8220;Lets take the roof, I know a way down.&#8221;

Walden:  &#8220;Alright.&#8221;

&nbsp;

The two brothers make their way up a series of ladders and find themselves on the main roof.  The parking lot is crawling with the infected so they lower themselves to a lower portion of the building where they intend to make their escape.  They realize a layer of barbed wire has been added to the roof preventing an easy descent.

&nbsp;

Walden:  &#8220;There&#8217;s no way down from here.&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;The wire goes down right here, this is our best spot.  We gotta jump.&#8221;

Walden:  &#8220;Are you fuckin&#8217; crazy?  That shit&#8217;s like twenty feet high!&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;Look, just jump right there.  Right when you hit just fucking roll.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Walden appears less optimistic then Wayne but realizing it&#8217;s their best chance at survival he agrees.

&nbsp;

Walden: &#8220;Alright.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Walden walks up to wall and glances down, takes a few steps back and jumps. Wayne makes sure he&#8217;s alright then joins him without hesitation.

&nbsp;

Wayne:  &#8220;Hey you alright?  Alright I&#8217;m coming down, just a sec.&#8221;

&nbsp;

They take cover and realize the zombies are surrounding Walden&#8217;s red BMW in the parking lot.

&nbsp;

Walden:  &#8220;How are we gonna get to the car?  They&#8217;re everywhere!&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We need a distraction.&#8221;

Walden:  &#8220;Yeah we do.&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;Oh shit, check that out.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He motions to a zombie alone near a tree still wearing brown rental skates.

&nbsp;

Walden:  &#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot it.&#8221;

Wayne:  &#8220;I&#8217;m not gonna shoot it, I got a plan.  Wait here.&#8221;

Walden:  &#8220;Alright.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Walden crouches down and watches as Wayne beats the zombie a few times over the head with the butt of his gun.  He removes the brown rental skate and uses the blade to viciously hack the foot off.  He throws the foot into the parking lot which lures the Zombies away.  As they fight over the foot Walden and Wayne hop the fence and break for the car.
