Last election, Stockton [voters passed Measure M](http://votersedge.org/ca/en/ballot/election/area/42/measures/measure/2154?election_authority_id=39) to fund Library and Recreation services. The City of Stockton administration is now proposing that Measure M funds be diverted for landscape maintenance and janitorial services. 
<br>
This proposal to divert over $500,000 in funds from its original purpose to the landscape and janitorial contract will be on the City Council agenda on Monday, December 4th, at 5:30pm.
<br>  
A group of community members worked with dozens of volunteers to pass Measure M on the November 8, 2016 ballot. The measure is designed to support and expand library and recreation services in Stockton that were devastated during Stockton’s bankruptcy through a dedicated ¼ cent sales tax. Measure M was passed by 76% of Stockton voters who went to the polls.

_The “Yes on M” campaign was passed by over two-thirds of votes._
<br>
**Here’s some quick facts about [why Measure M was needed](http://www.stocktongov.com/government/departments/clerk/measureM.html):**<br>
* Stockton San Joaquin County Library System spends $15 per resident on library service: The State average is $40 per resident.
* Stockton San Joaquin County Library System averages 0.25 square feet per resident; the state average is 0.72.
* Stockton ranks 64 out of 75 largest metropolitan areas in the United States for its parks and recreation services.
* Stockton has 0.4 community centers per 20,000 residents; the national average is 0.84.
* Stockton has a growing population, lack of public facilities, low literacy rates, high obesity rates, and public safety concerns.  <br>
<br>
In addition, [research](http://www.nrpa.org/uploadedFiles/nrpa.org/Publications_and_Research/Research/Papers/Witt-Caldwell-Full-Research-Paper.pdf) has shown a strong correlation between library and recreation services and reduced crime.<br>

<br>
On Monday, the City Council will consider a proposal to use $530,000 in Measure M funds (referred to by the City as “Community Services funds”) for landscape maintenance and janitorial services. $500,000 of this would be an ongoing cost for up to 7 years. According to the City’s staff report [(pp. 97-103)](http://www.stocktongov.com/clerk/granicusagendas/citycouncil/20171204.pdf), if this money is used for landscape and janitorial maintenance, it would “preclude the development of the proposed multi-use Sports Complex,” a key element of the Measure M plan. It was not the intention of Measure M to cover landscape maintenance and janitorial costs.<br>
<br>
Stockton residents who are concerned about this diversion of funds away from library and recreation services should contact their council member or the Mayor or attend Monday’s City Council meeting [Monday at 5:30pm](http://stockton.granicus.com/GeneratedAgendaViewer.php?view_id=48&event_id=1105) to express their concerns.
