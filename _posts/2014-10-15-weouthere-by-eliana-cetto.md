  In an attempt to consciously examine myself and my greater societal context, I use the archive of my Instagram feed as a contact-sheet replete with reflexive content and Internet tropes. This critical analysis of my use of Instagram conventions allows for a better understanding of the cultural self, and an exploration of new communal languages.
</p>

<p style="color: #444444;">
  I am interested in the continual, obsessive documentation of life via my<br /> cell phone and the multitude of participants who aid in the development of our contemporary social archive. #weouthere acts as a physical representation of an online experience, illuminating contemporary modes of photography as forms of self-preservation, surveillance, and resistance.
</p>

<p style="color: #444444;">
  I enjoy slowing down the hyper speed of phone applications by extracting virtual content into the physical space through the analog process of photopolymer printing. This allows me to elongate my experiences with digital image making and the ever-growing archive, while allowing me to reassess my experiences, memories, and vanities.

  <em>Eliana Cetto is a lens based media artist specializing in multimedia photo/video installations and alternative photographic processes. She is currently pursuing her Masters of Fine Arts degree at San Jose State University where she studies and teaches Photography. But she stays reppin&#8217; da dub nine. </em>
</p>

_<span style="color: #444444;">Her work is an exploration of image and identity in the 21st century with a focus on societal interactions within emerging and evolving technologies, utilizing lens based media, handmade books, and text. As an avid Internet blogger and iPhone junky, she approaches art making through the aesthetics of the Millennial Generation. She is also intrinsically interested in the critical examination of the social experiences of women as her research is grounded in intersectional feminism and queer theory.</span>_
