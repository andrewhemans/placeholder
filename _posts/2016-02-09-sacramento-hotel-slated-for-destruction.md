Art under the impetus of dynamite rejuvenates the tired soul of the hotel before its final exhale scheduled later this week. A line of people outside an otherwise grim facade was a clear marker for the building. We were told to head into the Ruhstaller Brewery next door to get a sticker; it was a yellow label with the logo, date, and scheduled time of entry. As we walked in, strands of white plastic were hanging from the ceiling, hazing and isolating, cleansing us, the visitor, in preparation. Welcome to the ArtHotel.

The first floor greets you with a pendulum penetrating each floor from a top floor, compelling you to its source. In the ArtHotel, exploration is encouraged, as every nook and cranny is whispering a little secret that only you may hear; a talkative staircase may surprise you, remembering to look up will reward you. Although sometimes the whispers can turn into a flurry of intentional cacophony, especially in the slender hallways of the building, each room is immersive and some are even interactive; write a post-it note in a magenta closet to voice your comments to a fictional corporation, plaster your face on a brick building adjacent to the hotel with a projector, or grab a skateboard and enjoy the kitchen-to-bedroom half-pipe ride.

Next to fine art and potty jokes, on the corner of political satire and schizophrenic ramblings, and around the racket of love, beauty, and foul, you will find the ArtHotel to be a menagerie of emotions.  Bring some water, put away the watch, and explore the short breath of the Art Hotel before its planned demolition.
