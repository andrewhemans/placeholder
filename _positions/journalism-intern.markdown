## Journalism Intern

**Are you the right fit?** We can help you determine that with these questions:

* Do you click on hyperlinks on news stories or articles to check their sources?

* Do you want to pursue a career in mediaâ€”either in writing, television, or radio?

* Do you have exceptional communication, writing and/or editing skills?

* Do you want to broaden your experience in media and explore  how media reaches its audience?

* Do people with different ideas or cultures excite you?

* Do you have something to say to the world?

* Are you able to meet deadlines for projects?

**If you answered "Yes" to at least three of these questions, then read on!**

**Job Description**

You will work closely with the editor-in-chief and the coordinating editor. They will help steer you towards assignments that interest you, but also assign you stories that Placeholder Magazine needs to cover. There will be opportunities to work with both audio and video elements of journalism. You will learn how an upstart editorial team works, how to write a variety of pieces based on your audience or topic, as well how to promote content online. All editorial interns are required to write a piece per week.

**Timeline & Commitment:**

Commit to at least 3 months part-time, 10-20 hours a week. You can work from home with teleconference calls and some in-person meetings.

**What do we offer?**

Placeholder Magazine is an all-volunteer not-for-profit organization, so this internship is unpaid. We highly encourage students who can receive academic credit to apply. You will gain experience in marketing, online content creation, writing, and the operations of an innovative, community-driven organization. You will also get to meet, network, and collaborate with other creatives. We are based in Stockton but have members throughout the state and beyond. *We strongly encourage women and people of color to apply.*

**How to apply:** Please email your resume, 1-2 samples of your work, and a short bio to [intern@placeholdermag.com](mailto:intern@placeholdermag.com)
