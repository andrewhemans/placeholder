## Multimedia Intern

Placeholder Magazine is looking for a highly creative, motivated and driven individual who can conceptualize and produce creative campaigns and a wide variety of photo and video content as a Multimedia Intern.

## Qualifications:

* Experience with DSLR photography and videography

* Experience with video production and video editing

* Should be proficient in nonlinear video editing software, such as Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro (Photoshop and After Effects is a plus)

* Having his/her own DSLR with HD video capabilities is preferred, but not required

* Ability to make creative decisions independently, as well as take direction from others

## Responsibilities:

* **Must** be available and able to travel to events in the area to take photos or video frequently (3-4 events a month)

This is an excellent opportunity to gain experience and build a portfolio through a creative, collaborative, non-profit organization. This internship is unpaid and approximately 3 months long. If you are taken on as an intern and would like to continue working for Placeholder after 3 months, that is also an option and will be decided based on the quality of the work you have produced during your internship.

## How to apply:
