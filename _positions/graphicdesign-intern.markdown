Be part of a movement: join a local, innovative and community-driven arts organization! Placeholder Magazine is an independent critical voice covering contemporary arts, culture, and literature. We are a Central Valley based non-profit arts organization led entirely by volunteers.

* Having his/her own DSLR with HD video capabilities is preferred, but not required
* Ability to make creative decisions independently, as well as take direction from others

## Responsibilities:

* Creating graphics in support of Placeholder campaigns and events
* Tracking and meeting deadlines for projects.
* Designing graphics for print, (e.g., fliers, posters, handbooks, etc.)
* Designing graphics for web, (e.g., infographics, email headers, illustrations for articles, etc.)

## What you will learn:
* Creative thinking within the bounds of a brand
* How to work and communicate about design with people of varying expertise and purposes
* The design process in an organization
* Initiate and innovate! We encourage ideas and suggestions!


## What do we offer?

Placeholder Magazine is an all-volunteer not-for-profit organization, so this internship is unpaid. We highly encourage students who can receive academic credit to apply. You will gain experience in marketing, online content creation, writing, and the operations of an innovative, community-driven organization. You will also get to meet, network, and collaborate with other creatives. We are based in Stockton but have members throughout the state and beyond. *We strongly encourage women and people of color to apply.*
