# About Placeholder

Placeholder Magazine is an independent critical voice covering contemporary arts, culture, and literature. We are a Central Valley based non-profit arts organization led entirely by volunteers. Through print and digital mediums, we provide an accessible forum for diverse voices as well as energize and activate young leaders through artistic practice, collaborative and collective decision making, and community-based projects locally and beyond.

Our website was built on various open source and free platforms, feel free to view our code to see our process. To style and layout our website we used the [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework. Our content management system is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
