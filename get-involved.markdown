To get involved in the content creation of Placeholder, you may [submit your work](#submit), [become an intern](#intern), or [join the team](#join-team).

<h2 id="submit">Submit Your Work</h2>

**Outside Submissions Guidelines**

Are you a writer, artist, graphic designer, illustrator, photographer, or all of the above? Placeholder features work from established and emerging creative talent. While Stockton and the surrounding Central Valley is our home base, we welcome art, literature, and culture from around the world.

By opening our organization up to outside submissions, we hope to not only widen the breadth of our content, but also to provide a space in which local writers and artists can gain exposure. By sending your work to Placeholder, you are representing yourself—if you are published, your work represents itself, and does not have to adhere to the views of Placeholder.

To submit your work, please email us at (….) Please include the type of submission in the subject line (Example: Opinion Submission, Photo Submission, Satire Submission, etc.)

We accept submissions for:
Visual media
Non-fiction
Fiction
Photography
Videography

**Non Fiction**

Non-fiction includes news articles, opinion pieces, how-to articles, profile and interview pieces, exposés, human interest articles, essays, humor and satire, historical articles, inspirational pieces, research articles, and round-ups. We’re open to a lot. Surprise us!

**Fiction**

Placeholder is open to all narrative styles and forms. Send us your masterpiece. Short stories must be under 6,000 words. Poetry may be sent in as a single or a set (up to 5 poems).

**Visual Media**

Art and Photography must be sent as .jpeg files (quality of 300 DPI)

<h2 id="intern">Become an Intern</h2>

Placeholder offers non-paid internships that are approximately three months long. There are opportunities for writers, copy-editors, photographers, videographers, graphic designers, community organizers, and finance positions.

You may apply to be an intern at (….) with subject line “Intern Application”. Please include a paragraph about yourself and what you’d like to do, why you would like to intern with Placeholder, as well as samples of your work or links to samples of your work in the email. Resumé is optional.

We accept interns based on the needs of the organization. If we are considering you, your application will be forwarded to the appropriate circle in which you’re applying to intern, i.e., writing interns will be forwarded to a member of the editorial staff, and they will decide whether or not they can take you on, and will give you details on what exactly you will be doing if you are accepted.

If you are taken on as an intern and would like to continue working for Placeholder after three months, that is also an option and will be decided based on the quality of the work you have produced during your internship.

<h2 id="join-team">Join the Team</h2>

Our organization consists of unique individuals who are dedicated to their craft. Placeholder team members have worked with Al-Jazeera Plus, City and County of San Francisco, Lodi Sentinel, Sacramento Bee, Sutter Health, Sencha, and more!

Please include a short bio about yourself and why you would like to work for Placeholder, along with samples of your work. We will forward your work to the appropriate circle, and they will get back to you.
