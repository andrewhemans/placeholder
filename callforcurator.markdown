We are extremely excited to announce our first open call for curators for visual arts content! Our residency offers the opportunity to work with a group of independent organizers, writers, and editors to create relevant artist features for our web-based magazine. 
 
The Curatorial Residency consists of a three-month commitment to curating and editing visual arts content for Placeholder’s website. As an all-volunteer run organization, Placeholder is currently unable to compensate anyone for their labor; however, volunteering with Placeholder is an excellent opportunity to skillshare, develop your experience in arts administration, and help promote the talented artists’ communities in the California’s Central Valley. 
 
The residency is remote, though we do require occasional in-person meetings. As the Visual Arts Curator, you will be required to create 4 posts a month. A post can consist of interviews, showcase an artist’s series of work, include studio visits, videos, etc. You can get an idea of what kinds of content to develop by looking at previous curatorial work on our website.
 
## About us:
Placeholder Magazine is a fiercely independent critical voice covering contemporary arts, culture, and literature. We are a Central Valley-based not-for-profit arts organization led entirely by volunteers. Through print and digital mediums, we provide an accessible forum for diverse voices.

The ability to write at a professional or college level
