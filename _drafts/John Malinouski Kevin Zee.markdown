The arts of John Anton Malinouski and Kevin Zee are an unlikely meditation. These two most broadly work in altered perceptions, reposition our conditioned minds to further engaged with our own embedded realities. Their collaboration on the video Eject under their pseudonym NODDER is something of a gift to the dormant mind. Their separate practices are prolific on their own and to better understand the layers of this video, we must look into each artist's process.

John Mal is a man of many talents including writing and incense making, but for the sake of space we will look closely at his musical experiments. Found online in his many forms collectively as Pelvic Dew, John has developed a discography of music that miraculously builds an environment in space and moves you through nonlinear passages. Soundscapes that carry with them a weight that novels take hundreds of pages to unfold. Hold that thought in your mind, now to Kevin.

Yet another renaissance man, Kevin works primarily in photography and video, while also painting and making music. He works with a microscopic quality camera taking photos that take time to consume. To see what Kevin captures means to slow down and hone in focus. A meditation practice through slowing down time, these photos are a guided practice in crafting attentive appreciation. 
 

 
When these two artists come together, what they produce is somewhere between a trance experience and a meditation. Kevin slows us down as he guides us through time and space while John develops that space and gives that time a sense of importance. Their video provides us an opportunity to take time in unexpected spaces that are generally connoted with unfocused unsettled motion.

When asked about this piece, Kevin and John wrote that they “...listened to a planned experiment with inevitable unseen variables...” Their playfulness with their projects lends itself well to the daunting nature of most experimental art, allowing viewers to laugh with them as they consider and toy with time and movement within undefined environments. 
In their other collaborative videos, they continue to challenge themselves in molding spaces and navigating throughout them, as can be seen in their piece titled Skin.

Here are two biological innovations swinging together in separate hemispheres in thanks.
 
**Kevin Zee** finds tools to view ordinary objects through different perspectives and endlessly experiments until a natural pattern shows itself. His work now involves other artists just as much as himself. He incorporates efficiency and controlled experiments into his imagery. Kevin has an AA in Audio Production from American River College and a BA in Video Production from SFSU. 
 
**John Anton Malinouski** is a composer of words and sounds with a practice in making incense. He is the founder of Chapped, a national publication of creative writing by Replica Zines. He moves in mysterious ways.
