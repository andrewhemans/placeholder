### **High Tension Tower**
	*(after Rufino Tamayo’s* Torre de alta tensiόn, *1974)*

Morning rush hour on the corner
of Truxton and H a man’s shadow
boxes a streetlight I can’t tell 
if he’s stretching or lost in a bout 
with methamphetamines
in Dagny’s coffee shop later
a lawyer spills his paper cup 
on the table he shares with a highway 
patrolman and two other dark suits 
they leap back as if their light 
roast were electric the phone rings 
I don’t recognize the number they don’t leave
a message I find myself sweating
it’s not hot maybe the caffeine 
a woman carries a sleeping baby
in a carseat to the counter 
and orders something to go

###**Three Characters and a Bird**
	*(after Rufino Tamayo’s* Tres personajes y un pájaro, *1962)*

Feed the chickens chase the pigeons
          my son wants a cage something to hold

the bottlebrush orioles in spring
          summer anna’s hummingbird defends

the desert willow against all comers
          cooper’s hawk scouting scatters

mockingbird and scrub jay tussling
          over the toyon’s winter berries

and stone-feathered mourning doves
          flushed for seed it’s not the same

they’re not mine that’s true a hard 
          lesson for any of us to learn we watch

and want and are possessed by a drive
          to hoard all the beautiful things behind

lock and key and security subscriptions
          when do we learn acquisition means loss


### **Eroded Land** 
	*(after Rufino Tamayo’s* Tierra erosionada, *1972)*

The old man told me once to avoid
dust devils will suck the soul right outta
your chest boy I laughed and since have gone out 
of my way to run plunge long headfirst
into every ochre vortex to be
left bent sneezing coughing black grit before
the mirror in the bathroom sink nature
abhors a vacuum what has taken place
of my departed the county lays down
pre-emergent to prevent shoots forming
later sprays a systemic herbicide
to denude stragglers what’s left is a bare
aesthetic in keeping with brick concrete
asphalt I let my yard go to seed am
put on notice for failing to upkeep
community standards the neighborhood
watches appearances and closed keeps 
others its doors and orifices
