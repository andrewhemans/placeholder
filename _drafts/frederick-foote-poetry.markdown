**To Create a Sense of Community**

To terrify, shock, and dismay

To create landscapes of bleeding corpses<br>
and scarlet fields of mangled body parts

To recreate your homelands in distant places

To unite us all in a web of blood and treachery<br>
To sew tight the threads of death and destruction

To sing the praises of bombs, missiles, and poison gas<br>
To shout the patriotic prayers of justification and canonization 

To celebrate in the common language of violence<br>
To create unsustainable communities<br>
of suffering, rage, and fear

To create the ties that bind in communal carnage<br>
United we falter, fail, fall into common graves

Beyond horror, disbelief, and despair.<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Charlatan**

Comes now, a swaggering troll<br> 
ejaculating his heinous history<br>
retold as the hero’s glorious march

An assailant in political cloth<br>
claiming a lecherous license<br>
an ogre of boorish tradition

Our self-impaled<br> 
crass concrete cross

Our hypodermic<br> 
crown of opiate thorns

Our nightmare<br> 
reality show<br> 
revelation

Exposing our Janus<br>
faced alter egos<br>
bringing us

Face to face<br>
again.
