*## To Create a Sense of Community*

To terrify, shock, and dismay

To create landscapes of bleeding corpses 
and scarlet fields of mangled body parts

To recreate your homelands in distant places

To unite us all in a web of blood and treachery
To sew tight the threads of death and destruction

To sing the praises of bombs, missiles, and poison gas
To shout the patriotic prayers of justification and canonization 

To celebrate in the common language of violence
To create unsustainable communities
of suffering, rage, and fear

To create the ties that bind in communal carnage
United we falter, fail, fall into common graves

Beyond horror, disbelief, and despair. 

*## Charlatan*

Comes now, a swaggering troll 
ejaculating his heinous history
retold as the heroâ€™s glorious march

An assailant in political cloth
claiming a lecherous license
an ogre of boorish tradition

Our self-impaled 
crass concrete cross

Our hypodermic 
crown of opiate thorns

Our nightmare 
reality show 
revelation

Exposing our Janus
faced alter egos
bringing us

Face to face
again.
