so I’m reading about these baby sharks lately
baby sharks in big city aquarium tanks    only mother sharks        no father sharks in these tanks
holy smokes where did that baby shark come from    so I googled it and read also about
baby lizards baby snakes certain insects a few species of birds 
all observed in captivity         so who the heck knows what’s happening out in the wild
parthenogenesis    scientists call it 
the phenomenon of virgin birth       spontaneous reproduction     occurring   when a species is 
under profound environmental stress
now apart from the obvious implications regarding the necessity of father sharks
father lizards father snakes father insects fathers    and perhaps the y-chromosome in general 
and with a nod to my catholic upbringing       lapsed and resentful as I am
I am wondering if anyone has considered the virgin mary in light of such science 
since baby jesus was born at a time when his own species was under duress
and the virgin birth part     was the first piece of that fairy story    that sounded fishy to me so 
what if 
that bewildered girl in galilee in the cradle of civilization or hotbed of 
intolerance and brutality     take your pick          what if poor unsuspecting mary
won our species’ lottery    or simply drew the short straw         was chosen was 
ordained by the principles of        darwinian evolution
was not exactly    visited      by the 
angel gabriel though it is a lovely story 
maybe mary the perpetual virgin was simply in the right place 
at the right time or the wrongest time the catastrophic time
was charged by the universe and
parthenogenically conceived   or created   engendered    manifested        on her own
by herself        an answer to the maelstrom
magically birthed a savior at a time when humankind needed saving
(now we can never know the pillow talk in that bedroom in nazareth     but for the record   joseph 
must have been a mensch)
but how ingenious that virgin mother how special that infant how unique and powerful that young man 
to so     mostly posthumously       captivate the world      
and the legacy of that thrall notwithstanding
for even jesus      that prince of peace     got co-opted by the haters
    are we     not     just last year next week this morning at 7:20     2000 or so years later          
up the creek without a paddle     again       in catastrophic times
are we not seething as a species under profound distress   did I mention the haters
 and the rest of the         rutting    father shark  hierarchy
are we not       then        by exquisite scientific extrapolation    by the miracle of chance
given the facts of population increase        and the intolerance and the brutality
and the global warming and the odds and the beautiful baby sharks abounding
given the well-documented ingenuity           of the queen of heaven herself
are we not here today    this minute    among the teeming masses
probably                        hopefully              inevitably
surrounded by saviors?
