**ESSENTIALS**<br>

I couldn’t have more than one soft drink.<br>
You weren’t in the mood to dance.<br>
We might’ve lost the seashell you sent last Christmas/<br>

They won’t replace it at the store.<br>
All morning the cartoon koala. Essential oil.<br>
I couldn’t have been clear about what I wanted;<br>

you weren’t nodding or saying, *I got it,* we might’ve<br>
known the ocean is a flak jacket,<br>
taking rounds of “They won’t,” bodies returned<br>

to shore all morning, bloated sand<br>
washed from our glasses—better to eye<br>
the wave rolling back/<br>

into itself—blubber and blood<br>
towed from our mouths.<br>
The crustaceans croon<br>

for slices of light, for young bare feet<br>
and what do we do but follow<br>
the footprints &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never leaving<br>

the beach. Cooler of sodas and boom box<br>
for dancing. It’s Christmas, and the tree is a sand<br>
castle. I bought the world<br>

so now it’s my store—my koala<br>
mimicking itself in the glass pane.<br>
All morning the plankton and I<br>

tried to empty the sand of its coffer<br>
moist dollars, to feel and fossil.<br>

**DISGRACED SPACEMAN**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***2091***<br>

You can see barn wreckage<br>
cropping the rise. Great-grandpa<br>
tilled this sorry soil he slouches<br>
over. Not looking for jettisoned<br>

reentry scrap; mere roaming.<br>
You can see a grainy beard, wisps<br>
surfing the breeze. The first<br>
commander discharged—hocking<br>

ears of corn without intergalactic<br> 
tariffs. A little space-oil on the side,<br>
moon-boot thrusters, rings carved<br>
from Saturn’s surface. You can<br>

see the rocket cattails<br>
tower-humped in the swooning dale:<br>
what excrement provides gratis.<br>
The cow-trail a mystery no sleuth<br>

hankers after. You can see moonbeams<br>
cluster on his glass eye. You can see<br>
how words miss his mouth; lank dome<br>
of gravity’s arm-bar spidering earth.<br>
<br>
