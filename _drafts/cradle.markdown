there is a line         a long one
saturday at the P is a busy day
the P    or the V de P   or simply the Vatican
the saint vincent de paul society thrift shop on route 28
run by a catholic church        staffed mostly by old women        
despite my rancor for the church I go almost every saturday      
sometimes tuesdays too         for the thrill of the bargain
the hipness of upcycling        the stories in every cast-off
today is busy         everything is half off      so there’s the line    in addition to which
the lady jamming things up today has a voucher<br>
meaning she is in a pickle and received a voucher from the church aid society to shop here
most of us      us regulars    come here hunting for treasure     the cashmere scarf   
the perfect chair for the guest room      the vintage table cloth      just last week I 
scored a brand new bialetti moka pot and another cardigan I’ll never wear
most of us shop here for fun
but the woman jamming up this line has a voucher   has a heap of stuff on the counter    mostly children’s clothes        by the look of it she has at least an infant and a toddler and a couple school-age kids     
she has jeans and sweatshirts and pajamas and t-shirts and socks and onesies and coats and sweaters and sneakers and rainboots         also towels and two sheets and even 
a brand-new-still-with-the-tags-on twin size star wars comforter with matching sham
Janet who is 83 is ringing each item in and Peg who is 87 if she’s a day is folding and bagging               
so slowly
taking time to exclaim over each thing   would you look at that hardly worn at all    or    isn’t that precious? 
Janet holds up a tiny sweater and declares it a handknit     you pay good money for that at a craft fair 
so very slowly excruciatingly really  the sale is rung in and bagged   with many pauses to check the total against the voucher to make sure she doesn’t go over
the man next to me in line sighs loudly at regular intervals and people behind him grumble and shift in the way put-upon people in lines do       the inconvenience of it all you know      the guy next to me mumbles   not out of earshot        of course she has a voucher        like poor people are the bane of his existence 
like he himself is not waiting in line in a thrift shop to buy a used pair of  swim trunks     and the woman ahead of me looks back at swim trunk dude and rolls her eyes in agreement with him       like this poor mother with a voucher is totally harshing her saturday morning yard-saling thrift-shopping chill 
there is not a single thing for herself on the counter  
unless you count the threadbare mismatched towels         
she is young    too young for four kids   thin   haggard   nails chewed to the cuticle     she looks anxious   harried     aware of the line behind her     
aware of her voucher  
but Janet and Peg are in no rush     if anything   they slow down     folding everything just so       
as if they know that no one takes time for this woman         
all the kids’ clothes are lovingly stowed in a gap shopping bag      
all the linens into a ridiculous lily pulitzer tote      comforter in an oversized birthday gift bag like it’s a present       they pamper her in a way only old catholic thrift shop ladies know    like they are packing her trousseau        
her hope chest  
they mutter over the total    checking and rechecking the number   
and Janet announces at last that there is $1.75 left over      
the line knows there is no cash back on vouchers and groans in unison       
great   she’s gonna have to pick something else out        
but Peg says I know just the thing and bustles out from behind the counter and into the shop   
for 87 she’s pretty fast      returns in a flash triumphant     with a dress     
like a bridesmaid dress    a gown really   beautiful   deep pink   impractical       this color is perfect for you  
Peg says   holds it up to the woman     and it is indeed perfect    you would be so lovely in this    like 
Peg is fairy godmother and tonight is the ball  
she tears the ten dollar ticket off the sleeve of the dress and gives Janet an even look
one seventy-five, Janet     she says    Janet nods knowingly    like the nuns in the sound of music at the end when they take the distributor cap out of the nazis’ car         one dollar and seventy five cents  Janet says precisely as she peers through her readers and punches the numbers in      
Peg folds the dress so carefully      and the line is mesmerized     
one because it is a lesson in the dying art of ball gown folding      
and two because it is an act of such tenderness     
Peg cannot touch this woman   stroke her hair   hold her hand    tell her that in this moment she is cherished   but she can fold this lovely dress    so gently tucking the crinoline   folding the bow   smoothing the sleeves       she folds this dress like a sacrament     like jesus washing the feet of the disciples     
there is a change in the line     a lightening      
a silent cheer that the sale is almost complete for sure
but also a shift now for the woman    toward the woman   the line leans in a little       
as if the dress   or        the gesture of the dress    the patient slow folding of the dress   make eye rolling lady and swim trunk dude imagine the woman with the voucher as someone else   
Janet and Peg finish the sale are all business again     they sign off on the voucher and hand over the bags
she thanks them sheepishly and starts to leave    avoiding eye contact with the line behind her     Peg calls after her      don’t forget your star wars comforter! that’s a prize!   and leans over the counter with the last tote          the one that looks like a big present         she makes a joke      
may the force be with you! she calls      
she has no idea

but how ingenious that virgin mother how special that infant how unique and powerful that young man
