&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is pounding like a jackhammer. My Jell-O-like legs are jiggling. My palms are slick with sweat. Standing on top of the file cabinet in my office at 6:30 AM, I pause to catch my breath. I need to steady myself. I’ve never viewed our workspace from this perspective.  There is a peace and quiet that’s not usually present. Minus all the executives, the ego cloud is dissipated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the elite floor of the bank. I realize, from this vantage point, that it looks like a maze. I close my eyes for a moment and imagine us all as superior rats. I’m sure that some of the staff think of us this way. These are the offices of the internal auditor, vice president of operations, human resources, payroll, and others that direct the daily activities of the worker rats.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough wool gathering! I must complete my mission before anyone else arrives on the floor. If I get caught, I’ll be fired. I’m about to climb over the wall into the internal auditor’s office and kidnap his African violet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the payroll clerk. Because of the nature of our work, the internal auditor and I share a secured corner space. Each of us has individual keys to unlock private offices. We each lock our doors every time we leave. We have confidential information that must be protected.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal auditor — I’ll call him John, because that’s his name — is not well-liked in the organization. If you work in business, you know that’s often true  about anyone who holds this position. It has nothing to do with his or her personality, though it sometimes might. It has more to do with the fact that this person is always pointing out what you are doing wrong. Most of us find that annoying.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is not a bad guy overall, though he’s a bit of a whiner. It’s his view of the female population that is grating. He makes comments like “Women should be barefoot and pregnant”   and “Women were meant to serve men.” I surmise that his wife rules the roost, so he puffs himself up at work. I used to counter with snarky comebacks, but that just egged him on, so I stopped. I decide to bide my time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Employee Appreciation Day, each employee received an African violet. John dotes on his; when he makes his daily visit to my office, he tells me how well he’s taking care of it with fertilizer and appropriate watering. As he expounds on his green thumb, an idea formulates in my head. Which led me to today. I will hold his plant hostage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I peer into John’s office and plan my descent. I’ve been in it before, so I know that his cabinets are placed in a way that I can clamber my way down. As I step over the wall, onto the tallest metal cabinet in his office, I chastise myself for wearing pantyhose. Dang! I almost slide off! Anyone who wears control-top pantyhose knows that taking them off and putting them back on would take an inordinate amount of time, which I don’t have. I’ll just have to be careful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once on the floor of his office, I scoop up his African violet and set it atop the taller cabinet. Then, I climb onto the short one and work my way up I transfer his plant over the wall, and then I step over. My heart is pounding; f I’m caught, I will not be able to explain that this was a joke. Arriving back on the solid, carpeted floor of my office, I breathe a sigh of relief.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my pulse settles, I look around trying to decide where I will place the plant. I throw caution to the wind and put it on the windowsill, next to my plant. The next step is sending the ransom note. I did my prep for this by lifting various interoffice envelopes from other departments. I dare not use one of mine, because even if I black out the previous sender, there’s the possibility of identification.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mimic a true kidnapper, I had cut up little pieces of paper and glued them on a larger sheet. John’s good at discovery, so I prepared all of this at home — no way to trace it to work materials, which, for John, would have compounded this caper, because I would be misappropriating company supplies.
The first note says: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I place the note in the envelope and scribble John’s name on it with my left hand to disguise my signature. I lock up my office, then the outer door and go for coffee next door. John usually comes in before me, and I don’t want to cast any suspicion by being there when he arrives. On my way to the elevator, I bury the envelope in the receptionist’s inbox. She 	distributes these envelopes throughout the floor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I return at 8:30 AM to bedlam. John is scurrying from office to office, trying to sniff out where his plant is and who sent the note. As soon as I exit the elevator, he accosts me, describing the details of the situation in his sing-song voice. I feign surprise. He follows me to my office.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take off my coat and sit. He paces back and forth lamenting about his situation. I ignore his babble, mostly because I’m afraid I will laugh. I shuffle through papers as he rambles on, so I can maintain composure. He cannot believe anyone would do this. Finally, he leaves. I shut my door, put my head down and enjoy a delicious, silent laugh.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, I send another demand note, composed in the same manner as the first. It says:

To get your precious African violet back alive, you must wear a pink shirt to work. You will start the day by standing in the common area and giving a ten minute speech on why you believe women to be the smarter and stronger sex. You will praise the women on this floor every hour, on the hour. Each day that goes by without your compliance will result in a severed appendage from your plant.  
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I place the note in another camouflaged envelope, along with one of the leaves from his plant. I wait until everyone leaves for the day and place the envelope in the stack in the receptionist’s box.  
            
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrive the next morning, John comes into my office. He is incensed. He will not comply with these stupid demands. As he goes on about the unfairness of the situation, he has a clean sight to his plant sitting pretty next to mine. Absorbed in pontification, he never sees it.  
          
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes on for several days — John complaining, me cutting off leaves and sending them to him. Every time he comes into my office to ruminate, I can barely conceal my amusement. I offer fabricated sympathy.  
          
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John never complies with the demands. And I stop mutilating the plant. The fun is over. My scheme may not have had the result that I’d hoped, but when I resigned from the bank, I left with two African violets.
