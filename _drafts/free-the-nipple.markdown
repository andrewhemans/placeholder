A gender equality movement to "Free the nipple" is a campaign arguing that women should have the ability to truly be at ease with their bodies— to show their nipples in public. In other words, this is a way to empower women and help them love their bodies. This is part of a bigger movement that women have been fighting for years, because the female body has been over-sexualized. Neutralizing the human nipple is a simple way to equalize both genders. 

The male nipple is pointless. “The presence of nipples in male mammals is a genetic architectural by-product of nipples in females. So, why do men have nipples? Because females do.” https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-men-have-nipples/   In comparison, the female breast nourishes our offspring, providing the most nutritious food for our young. Humanity has been facing nipples, literally, from the very beginning of our lives. It only seems natural to view the nipple.
 

Puritan values in America have prevented the women to go topless for longer than their European counterparts. Although some places in the US have a history of nudity, contemporary American society still shuns the nourishing circles of flesh. In New York, it became legal for women to go topless in 1992. Nevertheless, during the filming of “Free the Nipple” multiple women were arrested for being topless. The cop accused them of shooting porn.

In film, a group of topless men is typically unlabeled as “sexual content.”


Given that women’s breasts are the source of nurture for children, the female nipple is, ironically, not labeled as “family friendly content.” It is often turned down to be shown in any public setting. If any form of the female nipple is shown, even in art, it is typically in a sexually charged setting, or other adult settings such as a bar or club.



As a female artist, going topless is something that I've personally done for photo-shoots on multiple occasions. From my experience, going topless in art makes you vulnerable to being sexualized by the viewer. During one such shoot, I have had people question the relationship I have with the photographer. "Did he touch you?," "Was his lady in the room?," "Was it just you two?"

If a man did this with his shirt off, they would be less inclined to ask these sort of questions. I felt as if I had to defend and desexualize my actions to avoid judgement. 


Photography is an art. The body is art. Both should be respected and both are used collaboratively to create a beautiful piece. The photos shouldn’t question the relationship between the model and the photographer or personal relationship with any human. Males have been showing their nipples for nearly one hundred years; it’s 2017, nipples are nipples. Let's be vulnerable and make art. 



I showed my nipples for the art of it.  
If you only see sexual content, I feel bad for you.
