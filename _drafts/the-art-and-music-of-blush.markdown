**Curator's Note:** I’ve been admiring Kristen Barredo’s artwork from afar for a few years since meeting her in Stockton back in 2009-ish. We both eventually ended up moving Sacramento, and I was really excited to see her again in the Sacramento scene. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard she had a band that dropped this new beautiful album and made all the visuals for it. Her drawings are dreamy, sensual, and retro. This girl can draw like no other, has an incredible sense of style, AND she can sing. Dance the winter away with this three tunes from *Blush.*

>"We want people to dance to good beats and heart wrenching lyrics."

Blush is a funk, and pop duo formed in Sacramento CA. The band consists of music producer and keyboardist Jaycob Greenlee, and vocalist Kristen Barredo. Their music has been described as “a dive-y nightclub," or “Aaliyah meets Washed Out" by listeners. With a rich layered sound, the tracks feature funky guitars, synths, catchy bass-lines, dynamic drums under Kristen's smooth haunting vocals. The funky old-school production will get your head bobbing immediately. 

"We are both are heavily influenced by the soothing tunes of Sade, we want people to dance to good beats and heart wrenching lyrics. We just released our first mix tape this year and looking into playing more local shows."

"I really wanted to emulate movement into my illustrations.  I liked the idea of illustrating a women dancing or anything candid for that matter. It was something I envisioned when listening to blush recordings for the first time. I've been getting bored of drawing face portraits and excessive hair. Visually I knew I needed to adapt to a different style. The album artwork for blush gave me the opportunity to challenge myself in my visual art practice again."

My brother is a graphic designer, and he’s been pretty helpful with text and color. He’s allowed me to be unafraid of bold colors, and go crazy with composition. Because, truly that is how I perceive our music,  high energy and colorful. My experience with making music for the first time really helped me evolve artistically. As long as Jaycob and I keep making music, I will keep broadening my horizons with art.
