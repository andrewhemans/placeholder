Blush is a funk, and pop duo formed in Sacramento CA. The band consists of music producer and keyboardist Jaycob Greenlee, and vocalist Kristen Barredo. Our music has been described as “ a dive-y nightclub “, or “Aliyah meets Washed Out" [by Javier Padilla]. We are both are heavily influenced by the soothing tunes of Sade, we want people to dance to good beats and heart wrenching lyrics. We just released our first mix tape this year and looking into playing more local shows. [Link below for booking]

I really wanted to emulate movement into my illustrations.  I liked the idea of illustrating a women dancing or anything candid for that matter. It was something I envisioned when listening to blush recordings for the first time. I've been getting bored of drawing face portraits and excessive hair. Visually I knew I needed to adapt to a different style. The album artwork for blush gave me the opportunity to challenge myself in my visual art practice again. My brother is a graphic designer, and he’s been pretty helpful with text and color. He’s allowed me to be unafraid of bold colors, and go crazy with composition. Because, truly that is how I perceive our music,  high energy and colorful. My experience with making music for the first time really helped me evolve artistically. As long as Jaycob and I keep making music, I will keep broadening my horizons with art.
