What do shopping carts, punks, and Indiana Jones have in common? Stockton. I had the pleasure of visiting the Reynolds Gallery at the Jeannette Powell Art Center of Pacific University’s Art Department. The gallery is a big open space with lots of natural light, sectioned by two rooms that serve as an art space. The Revolution Will Be D.I.Y is the current exhibition on view. It is a month-long event composed of installations, collaborative projects, and performances organized by Lisa Cooperman, the new University Curator, [Goodstock Productions](http://www.goodstockca.com/), and [Garrett Daniells](http://cargocollective.com/garrettcdaniells/filter/Mural/CV).

The space is divided modularly by a section with “craftivism” where the public can weave and make t-shirts, and a visual art section in which the work of Garrett Daniells, Jacob Porta, Chad Sengstock, and Hanna Thrasher, is on display. I was immediately drawn to the giant installation in the center of three suspended shopping carts that Daniells authored, titled *Desert Cornucopia*. The idea for this work is based on food scarcity, the work is referencing the Stockton food deserts and the struggle of University Students with proper nutrition due to low income. Daniells’ work is meant to be interactive, in invites the community to bring or take non-perishable foods and other hygiene items, the rest will be donated to [Little Free Pantries](http://www.littlefreepantry.org/), a not-for-profit that distributes it to communities in need in the Stockton region.

*Desert Cornucopia* is surrounded by several photo series representing different Punk Scenes in and outside the region from the 90’s on. The one that I was most interested on was Jacob Porta’s, because his photographic skill seemed more impressive than the others, but also because his photos are genuine and spontaneous. I saw some familiar faces in there, but also I noticed they represented a much more culturally diverse scene. 

> Porta described his series as connected to the challenging nature of the city of Stockton and the ethos of the Punk D.I.Y scene and its devotion to the community. 

All the subjects photographed by Sengstock and Thrasher are white, yet Porta’s work unintentionally portrayed a more inclusive scene, also a more current one in Stockton. Porta’s work unintentionally portrayed a the more current and diverse Stockton Punk scene. Porta’s work Youth Museum can be found online as well on  [youthmuseum.party](https://youthmuseum.party/)

The most interesting part of this exhibition aside from the visuals is the historical context between the University of the Pacific’s history of civil rights struggle for race social justice in the 60’s and 70’s, and also the seemingly new juxtaposition between an often disconnected student body of UOP and the music scene of the local youth. The exhibition will conclude with a free, all-ages show of Punk and Metal bands [NDN Giver](http://ndngiver.bandcamp.com), [Cheap Shoes](http://cheapshoes.bandcamp.com), [Knee Deep](http://knewwdeepca.bandcamp.com), and [xMalcolmx](http://xmalcomx.bandcamp.com) on April 13, 7 - 10 p.m. preceded by an art talk by Garrett Daniels at 6pm on the same day.

P.S. This excerpt form Indiana Jones' Raiders of the Lost Arch was filmed at UOP.
