The art of Waylon Horner takes a special look at your innards. Literally. Through the gooey mush and into the cogs and gears that are slightly off kilter in the depths of the mind. His paintings fall under the broad category of abstract surrealism, but with a closer look, one could see some figures within. His style, reminiscent of early computer graphics mixed with Disney cartoons, draws you in before it immediately puts you in a space of discomfort and curiosity.

His large compositions immerse your vision in a colorful explosion taking you on a journey through the surface with a few surprises along the way. For the most part, the paintings seem to be a jumble of squiggles, but like an episode of CSI, you’ll find a body part here and there. The chaos of lines brings a sense of disorder, however, his quality of line – it’s shiny veneer – and minimal figuration tempts the eye for a closer look.

And not to pull a “Georgia O’Keefe-esk Freudian psychoanalysis”, but Waylon’s art does have sexual undertones that come at you once you get past the flying guts. As you tumble through the work, a clitoris comes through, a curved finger, a nipple, a tongue. Taking the mind to sensual nights, discovering bodies through exploration. Perhaps serving as a map through the quivering experience, Waylon’s paintings strike a chord of all too familiar sexual navigation.

Either that or the intrusive thoughts that invade the psyche. Moving through the work flows like an active mind, jumping from one idea to the next through a thin thread of connected consciousness. Stopping here to pass through a window, zigzagging through space leaving “Kapow!” marks on the theoretical ground. Slime from unknown origin oozes and slows the eyes down. Navigating sporadically through in an unfamiliar terrain.

In the end, for all we know the imagery could all be sourced from bodily explosions. As Waylon says in his bio, his word is not meant to convey any message but serves a place for the viewer’s imagination to play… so maybe this review is more of a reflection on your author than anything else.

Waylon Horner is an abstract painter based in Sacramento. A self-taught artist with an associate’s degree in art from American River College. He spent years developing his own abstract aesthetic. His main goal is to create something of visual and psychological interest. He never has any sort of direct message or meaning behind his images, always leaving it ambiguous enough to let the viewer have a little fun with their imagination. Influences include H.R. Giger, Irving Norman, Robert Crumb, Hans Bellmer, Yves Tanguy, Roberto Matta, John Kricfalusi and Walt Disney.
