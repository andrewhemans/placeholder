A few years ago, we brought into the world a magazine in the midst of a dying print industry, inspired by good friends and good vibes, a sort of record to hold clearly that moment in time. In our most miserable city we got creative—how could we make days brighter, spark thoughtfulness, share parts of life through art? Create an avenue where trains of thought could run freely? 

Welcome to this introduction. We are both, a print and digital magazine. We’re an organization, which essentially is a series of relationships. A project unfolding many underneath it, an active exercise in building skills, an exploration of the most visual kind. 

Explore our archives and you might find some new thoughts, reaffirmations, or inspiration. Stay tuned for new content every couple of days, written by you and curated by yours truly.
