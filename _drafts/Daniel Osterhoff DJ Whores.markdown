Daniel Osterhoff transcended this world on April 8th and left behind a wake of energy that radiates warmth throughout the Sacramento creative community. Many have not even met the man yet the sense community he created permeates daily life in the city.  

DanO, better known as DJ Whores throughout the art and music scene, lived as an artist, DJ, a father, and a friend. He is the talent behind midtown rituals like *Grimey* and *Hump* at Midtown bars like the Press Club and Townhouse Lounge. In his SN&R interview with Nick Miller, DanO cites his mom’s influence on him, “Shoot, my mom had a wide range of music tastes, everything from jazz, funk, classic rock, blues rock—even, like, ’80s pop”. His playful mixes blend across musical styles to create a funky symphony for the sweaty central valley nights.

His mark is embedded into the capital with his murals, a staple in the community. Walking through midtown, his murals are more than just labels for buildings, they build a sense of belonging. His artistic craft inherited from his dad, a prolific artist in his own right, mixes his signature style font with bright and dramatic color and flare. His work inspires pride in the city, a familiar yet iconic marker of our public art. Skating down S street around lunch time you’ll see a crowd surrounding Dad’s Sandwich Shop. The sky blue building adorned in his sharp lettering has been a visual haven among brutal office and state buildings. A little farther down the road, locals are grabbing a drink at the moody B-Sides bar, where DanO painted the radio style façade. His mural breaks up the monotonous line of structures and drenches the view in nostalgia. His work can also be seen at Dimple Records, the American Market and Deli, Amaro, Old Gold, Bottle and Barlow, LowBrau, Seasons Coffee, Anthony’s Barber Shop, Blvck Blvck Salon and Barber, and elsewhere around town.

DanO lent his hand to the local arts organization M5 arts, where he created iconic logos for ArtHotel and ArtStreet. Striking, recognizable, and a symbol of home for many Sacramento artists. DanO’s handywork became a  beacon for artists and was imbued with a sense of home. His craft extends beyond beautifully transforming the names of shops, he uses his iconic lettering in his own artistic practice as well.

Most recently in his participation in the ArtStreet installation, he worked with artist John Dozier to create the mural *History Dies & Condos Rise*. Back in February, the transformed hanger-sized warehouse was home to this mural hidden in the center of the massive installation. The piece jabs at gentrification that is currently working its way through Sacramento while honoring the artists that are culture creators in these often-overlooked spaces. 
 
DanO made himself accessible in a way that artists don’t have to, and many choose not to. Through his public art and DJ practice he was actively assisting in building spaces of congregation and shared experience. DanO’s permanent mark in Sacramento lies not only in his murals, but in the community he built through his craft. At his memorial in late April, Southside Park filled with bodies, old friends and new, to pay homage to the prolific Sacramento mixer and maker. A DJ stage blasted DJ Whores mixes and other DJs came to mix in his honor. The prickly dry lawn turned into a dance floor – we celebrated DanO with our bodies and by sharing stories of wild warehouse parties, late night adventures, and his glowing love. Even those who had never officially met DanO could feel that he was a healer.  His energy channeled through the crowd exuded welcoming warmth and a hunger for community. The way people preserve his presence in themselves, in their minds, and in their actions. What DanO did for the city of Sacramento is not gone, and it will continue in perpetuity as long as we cultivate space for each other and keep it grimy.
