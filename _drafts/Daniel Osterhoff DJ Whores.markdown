Daniel Osterhoff transcended this world on April 8th, 2017 and left behind a wake of energy that radiates warmth throughout the Sacramento creative community. Many have never even met the man yet the sense of community he created permeates daily life.

DanO, better known as DJ Whores throughout the art and music scene, lived as an artist, DJ, a father, and a friend. He was the talent behind Midtown rituals like *Grimey* and *Hump* at bars like Press Club and Townhouse Lounge. DanO’s playlists were influenced by his mother’s broad music tastes, featuring playful mixes blended across musical styles to create a funky symphony on sweaty Central Valley nights.

His mark is embedded into the capital with his murals, which are staples in Sacramento. Walking through the city, his murals are more than just labels for buildings; they build a sense of belonging. He inherited his artistic craft from his dad, a prolific artist in his own right, mixing his signature font with bright and dynamic color and flare. His work inspires pride in the city, a familiar yet iconic marker of our public art. Walking down S Street around lunchtime you’ll see a crowd surrounding Dad’s Sandwich Shop. The sky blue building adorned in his sharp lettering is a visual haven among brutal office and state buildings. A little farther down the road, locals are grabbing drinks at the moody B-Sides bar, where DanO painted the radio style façade. His mural breaks up the monotonous line of structures and drenches the view in rich nostalgia. His mural work can also be seen at Dimple Records, the American Market and Deli, Amaro, Old Gold, Bottle and Barlow, LowBrau, Seasons Coffee, Anthony’s Barber Shop, Blvck Blvck Salon and Barber, and many other places around town including pop-up artist events.

DanO utilized his dramatic visual language to render the iconic logos for *ArtHotel* and *ArtStreet*, pop-up exhibitions by M5 Arts. Striking, recognizable, and a symbol of home for many Sacramento artists, DanO’s handiwork became a beacon for artists, a sigil to unite under. His craft extends beyond beautifully transforming the names of shops into his own artistic practice as well.

Most recently with his participation in an *ArtStreet* installation, he worked with artist John Dozier to create the mural featured above *History Dies & Condos Rise*. In February, the hanger-sized warehouse was home to this mural hidden in the center of the exhibition. The piece stabs at gentrification that is currently working its way through Sacramento while honoring the artists that are culture creators in these previously overlooked spaces.
DanO made himself accessible in a way that artists don’t have to, and many choose not to. Through his public art and DJ practice he was actively assisting in building spaces of congregation and shared experience. DanO’s permanent mark in Sacramento lies not only in his murals, but in the community he built through his creative practice. 

At his memorial in late April, Southside Park filled with bodies - old friends and new - to pay homage to the prolific Sacramento mixer and maker. A DJ stage blasted DJ Whores' mixes and other DJs came to mix in his honor. The prickly dry lawn turned into a dance floor and we celebrated DanO with our bodies and by sharing stories of wild warehouse parties, late-night adventures, and his glowing love. Even those who had never officially met DanO could feel that he was a healer.
 
His energy that channeled through the crowd exuded welcoming warmth and a hunger for community - the way people preserve his presence in themselves, in their minds, and in their actions. What DanO did for the city of Sacramento is not gone, and it will continue in perpetuity as long as we cultivate space for each other and keep it "Grimey".
