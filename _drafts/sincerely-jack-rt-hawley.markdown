_Loose_

To be scared to say what I wanna say 
We're on that warming griddle 
Just in the midst 
Of those waiting ruby flames to lick every one of us 
We're warming 
Warming fast 
Or slow 
And sow these seeds of resentment 
Towards myself towards these others I've felt 
That could have been my lovers and loyal friends 
But when we meet this velvet end 
Like the top of one of those tables 
You know 
The one you see in your grandmother's place. 
Was made in a time  with different tastes and feels and thoughts 
In a moment where people seemed bigger and more foundational within this world and the next 
Like layers of bricks and mortar 
One held the other in a strong gravelly embrace 
Now though 
I don't know what happened to that communal bricklaying
Might have been taken away from you or I 
Or we might have a fresh attempt at in our palms 
To lay bricks of different 
Colours
Sizes 
Feels 
Textures 
Material 
Some would say 
'What a shit wall, how'd that stand boy?' 
But this the experiment I'd hold true to myself and I'd show to others 
Each brick may sag or sink or shift
Each will sag into another
Sink only to be lifted up 
Shift so others can keep that void filled
Use of this wall has to portray our wild relationship too
So it can't block 
Or evict 
Or isolate man
We'll make a home from it, 
One blessed by welcoming fellows 
Who'll take others and love any 
They will be the shields of many. 

Vital news
If you want to play life like a fiddle 
then throw out the fiddle 
and buy a grand piano 



_Untamed_
my hair
itâ€™s coarse, rough, always in bristles
Why should I care
But how did these sweet birds 
come to swallow those hard whistles 


Staying Far away for Obvious and Not so Obvious reasons 
To whom 
and whom 
should I make it out to?
you wrote down an address 
However just like the rest 
you never gave me a picture of 
the last sight you saw 
when in dreary Ohio 
Or in crisply starched New England. 
You never gave me that lava-like kindness you felt in Vera Cruz 
Or that warmth on the sides of your neck in Berlin 
I am or we are 
Dishearten to hear the news 
the one you already knew 
back when you were in homeschool 
with that alcoholic father
who only passed, he threw, the baton to mother. 
You knew more then the next 
but you let it slap from your sides 
Only to lead to a new wild game of chutes and slides
and slides 
and sliding 
into my life 
That is exactly what you did 
For the best of two futures you left that other to see
that you needed me 
And now 
from this point on 
Who should I make it out to son?
