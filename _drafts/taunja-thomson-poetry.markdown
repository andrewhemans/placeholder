**The Harp**
**(for Augusta Savage)**

When the hand of God plucks<br>
each string shivers<br>
begets lovely beings—<br>
twelve straight-backed women<br>
children and men<br>
with shapely skulls lit<br>
like meteors<br>
and bodies draped<br>
in fine pleats.<br>
*Will no one bronze them?*<br>
asks the artist.<br>
*But, O,* says Her Beloved,<br>
*you have already sealed them*<br>
*with your lovely hands*<br>
*and they shine*<br>
*like your own star-burnished*<br>
*skin.*<br>


**No Apologies**

Woman sleeps enfolded 
in stalks of barley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yarrow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verbena<br>
her skin a cocoon 
of her potbelly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrinkles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ample waist<br>
thick dimpled knees—
she is her own field
sometimes sharp like blades of grass
at others bent like branches
or soft as moss
here pointed and aimed at sky
there watercolor-vague
and grounded.






























~inspired by the art of Christine Wu


Summer, 1975

We sat in the sunlit field
that afternoon
the lovely Spanish boy
and I.    Heart
came on the radio
singing Magic Man—
I sang along and he strummed
his guitar
randomly.
Spangles of sun danced
on the ground around us
leaping from one blade of grass
to the next like coins 
thrown at a gypsy caravan
frenetic reflections 
in a pool of green.
His mahogany eyes
wide with admiration
one moment    closed smoothly
the next
his brown fingers slowing
but never ceasing.
My long hair tossed shadows
brushed grass
and those fingers
moved from strings 
to flesh
from afternoon
to end-of-summer 
crickets with violin legs
leaning toward two warm bodies
basking in the sun’s 
silence. 







Ecstasy:

vibrating sharp
sung through teeth--soul notes
mouths glinting
honed into questions
hot skin   shiny bones
absolute experience
another stage
residual night: this dark
calling
humming moon


































The Conversation

Man with brown hat
minus one-half 
of one leg
props crutch 
under one armpit
reaches arms up 
to remonstrate    to explain    to extol sky
to goose-necked woman
with black umbrella
who holds her head back
hisses    listens    ripens into awe.
Four eyes glow like opals
behind thieves’ masks
while bodies    crutch    umbrella
shimmy on rain-swept street.






















~inspired by Bill Traylor’s painting “Man on Crutch and Woman with Umbrella”






The Briar

Everything is bright    garish    barbed.
A dry wind spreads 
horizon like orange waves.
Trees burn like lamb’s flesh.
These are dangerous times.  
The world is roaring
and numb.  
Yet I will take Rumi’s lion
and fan it into flame
become inside    outside
fire and balm.
Now is the time for action—
let us find our way
through this blazing briar
of razors.
