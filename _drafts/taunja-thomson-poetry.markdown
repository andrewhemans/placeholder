**The Harp**
**(for Augusta Savage)**

When the hand of God plucks<br>
each string shivers<br>
begets lovely beings—<br>
twelve straight-backed women<br>
children and men<br>
with shapely skulls lit<br>
like meteors<br>
and bodies draped<br>
in fine pleats.<br>
*Will no one bronze them?*<br>
asks the artist.<br>
*But, O,* says Her Beloved,<br>
*you have already sealed them*<br>
*with your lovely hands*<br>
*and they shine*<br>
*like your own star-burnished*<br>
*skin.*<br>


**No Apologies**

Woman sleeps enfolded<br> 
in stalks of barley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yarrow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verbena<br>
her skin a cocoon of her potbelly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrinkles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ample waist<br>
thick dimpled knees—<br>
she is her own field<br>
sometimes sharp like blades of grass<br>
at others bent like branches<br>
or soft as moss<br>
here pointed and aimed at sky<br>
there watercolor-vague<br>
and grounded.<br>

Summer, 1975

We sat in the sunlit field<br>
that afternoon<br>
the lovely Spanish boy<br>
and I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart<br>
came on the radio<br>
singing *Magic Man*—<br>
I sang along and he strummed<br>
his guitar<br>
randomly.<br>
Spangles of sun danced<br>
on the ground around us<br>
leaping from one blade of grass<br>
to the next like coins<br>
thrown at a gypsy caravan<br>
frenetic reflections<br>
in a pool of green.<br>
His mahogany eyes<br>
wide with admiration<br>
one moment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closed smoothly<br>
the next<br>
his brown fingers slowing<br>
but never ceasing.<br>
My long hair tossed shadows<br>
brushed grass<br>
and those fingers<br>
moved from strings<br>
to flesh<br>
from afternoon<br>
to end-of-summer<br>
crickets with violin legs<br>
leaning toward two warm bodies<br>
basking in the sun’s<br>
silence.<br>


Ecstasy:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrating sharp<br>
sung through teeth--soul notes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouths glinting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honed into questions<br>
hot skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shiny bones<br>
absolute experience<br>
another stage
residual night: this dark
calling
humming moon


































The Conversation

Man with brown hat
minus one-half 
of one leg
props crutch 
under one armpit
reaches arms up 
to remonstrate    to explain    to extol sky
to goose-necked woman
with black umbrella
who holds her head back
hisses    listens    ripens into awe.
Four eyes glow like opals
behind thieves’ masks
while bodies    crutch    umbrella
shimmy on rain-swept street.






















~inspired by Bill Traylor’s painting “Man on Crutch and Woman with Umbrella”






The Briar

Everything is bright    garish    barbed.
A dry wind spreads 
horizon like orange waves.
Trees burn like lamb’s flesh.
These are dangerous times.  
The world is roaring
and numb.  
Yet I will take Rumi’s lion
and fan it into flame
become inside    outside
fire and balm.
Now is the time for action—
let us find our way
through this blazing briar
of razors.
