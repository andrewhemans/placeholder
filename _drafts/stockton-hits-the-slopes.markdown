Let's face it: 2016 disrupted everyone's zen, and unfortunately, 2017 forecasts don't look much better. 

Years before the dawn of this new era that many would deem dystopian, our little town of Stockton was known as "most miserable." But, perhaps we Stocktonians are the lucky ones; we've developed the all character and pragmatism necessary to deal with it. Misery is no longer a threatening word. We've learned how to work the system, and how to make the system work for us. While the rest of the world struggles to regain their grip on reality, we're molding the clay of it, creating our own.

It is this fearless, been-around-the-block attitude that I encountered when I sat down to interview a local Stocktonian who informed me he'd like to be known as "Snowy Claus." He's the man behind Stockton SkiBus, a program forged by the idea that a system that caters to the privileged could be made to benefit those who aren't.

Essentially, Stockton Skibus invites kids from high schools within the Stockton school district, and shuttles them up to Squaw Valley for a day on the slopes. When asked why the anonymity, Snowy Clause responded with some wry comments about the Administration “a-holes,” but also stated that this interview wasn't meant to highlight him, but rather to promote the Stockton SkiBus program.

**So who are you, and what is "Stockton SkiBus"?**

Everybody who knows me in the program knows me as "Snowy Claus." I'm the coordinator for Stockton SkiBus, a 501c3 \[nonprofit\] that works with the various snow-sports resorts to provide snow-sports access to low income and disadvantaged youth at no or very little cost.

**So what do you and the kids do when you want to go up \[to the snow\]?**

Well, there's two scenarios: They go up and they get a lesson package, the use of equipment, and a lift pass—That's a kid who's never done it before. They're given everything that they need in order to enter the sport. Or, if they're experienced, they get the lift pass and the equipment.

**So you guys comp all their equipment?**

Everything is comped. In addition we loan or give them articles of clothing specialized for the snow.

**And is this mainly based in Stockton?**

No. It extends all over the country but Stockton is a big piece of it.

**OK, so if I was a kid attending, say, Edison high school, how would I go about doing this?**

I would say that one of the teachers, Sam Jones, is the snow sports club mentor or whatever they call him. In order for clubs to exist on high school campuses, a teacher has to agree to be the leader and they actually establish a club. And every once in awhile they'll on the loudspeaker, they'll say "the snow-sports club is having a blah blah blah, if you wanna learn how to snowboard or ski or see the snow, go see Mr. Sam Jones in room number 42," or something like that. It's just common knowledge in the school which teacher is the contact point.

**And how successful would you say the trips are?**

13 on a 10 scale.

**Really? So the kids love it.**

It's mind-bendingly good. I mean, it really is. First of all, on so many levels, it just transforms... And a lot of people are more involved in it, including the Peacekeepers, gang outreach, ya know, and it has to do with my original work with the founder Mr. Big Duck that you saw ... When he just started, it was him, me, and a few other people. And \[the kids\] get to see a world where you know, they don't have to worry about everything, everybody's nice, they love the sport—the sport is so addicting—there's actually a technical, medical reason why snow sports are addicting, it's something I could explain to you—it's technical.

Anyway, they get to see a world that's not “ghetto,” and it gives them something to work for, to be a good student for, it helps the teachers manage behavioral issues in the classroom because if they're bad we bounce them out (laughs).

One of the best things about the program is, prior to this company, SkiDuck, one of the things—well, I'm gonna talk: You've got money, you're from Germany, or you're German, you go to Santa Cruz, so you know money-people. I call 'em "trustafarians." See, here's the problem with this, and I'm gonna be insulting, almost...

**Go ahead.**

Nice people are nice, right? But they're kinda nice-Nazis. It's always at their convenience, and when they feel like it, but the thing is, when you're doing outreach, it really isn't about the outreach hitting at the benefactors convenience, it's about the beneficiary's need. So you have to operate on their schedule and with their needs. So a lot of what they'll do is they'll say "OK, we'll do all this nice crap for ya, but, you gotta do it the way I say it." And then if \[the beneficiaries\] don't do it the way they're told to do it, well, then they're the assholes and they get cut off. Or they just get a taste of it. And there's this class culture clash. I'll give you a perfect example:

This really happened: A high school from Stockton goes up there \[to Squaw Valley\] and the bakery gives 'em cookies. Really nice fancy cookies. And everybody's supposed to get one cookie. Well what do you think these kids from Stockton do when they get their one cookie? What's the next thing that happens?

**They take multiple.**

They got two cookies! Right? And so Mr. Big Duck got all crazy about it and said "Off-task behavior!" and "Rude!" all this crap, bounced 'em for one week. And then, when they got back home, \[the teachers\] had 'em give cookies to poor people and make a video and they wrote letters saying "We're sorry." Basically what the teachers were really saying to the kids was "just kiss their ass, these rich assholes—you know? They got the crap, we want it, they just can't stand the flavor." I mean, my attitude was, "Oh my god, \[at least\] no one got shot. You know?"

**That's how you know you're from Stockton.**

It's always this dance with the egos of the privileged class. And god bless 'em, they're nice people, but unless they're the rain-maker or they're self-made... When I was at Squaw a couple of days ago, I came down this mountain, and I'm rippin' down it (I been skiing for 40 plus years, I mean I'm good) so there's the single's line, and I zip into it, and I'm going fast and there's no place where I can make a wedge or a hockey stop, I don't wanna bump into people, so I kinda pull off to the left and scoot four or five positions up, and it looks like I'm cutting the line. I'm really not, I'm just trying to stop without hitting anybody. And then I figure I'll just wait, and let the line pass me up. Well about four or five places back, there's this idiot wearing a US Ski team shirt, yelling "Hey you can't cut the line! What are you doing?" I mean, if I cut the line that means he has to wait another 5 or 10 seconds before he can get on the stupid lift. I said, "Look, I'll just stand here and let you guys go by," but he wouldn't shut up. He wouldn't stop complaining. And as he's complaining, the line is moving, and I just stood there. And when he got in front of me, I got behind him, and I was like "See? It's all good dude." And I'm thinking to myself, "All you've got in life to worry about is whether somebody cuts off 10 seconds of your life in a lift line of a major ski resort? Where do you come from, man?"

**The trustafarian attitude?**

The trustafarian attitude—that's the word I made up—they're trustafarians, god bless 'em. That's the kind of political flavor of dealing with the clash of cultures. Anyway so there's a lot of dealing with that.

**How do the kids deal with that attitude?**

We tell 'em, straight up. I explain to them what the trustafarian thing is all about. And they get it, because we've got like Saint Mary's High School out here. I say, look kids, just leave the ghetto at home, tell 'em what they want to hear, be nice, give em some game, and you get all this free crap. Just don't be a knucklehead, and we'll hook you up!

**And they're pretty cooperative?**

They just totally get it. And they are totally cooperative. That's the best part. All of a sudden, they got something to lose if they act out, and they don't act out. Cause we prep 'em. And the other side goes, "Oh they're so cute! They're so nice!" And it gets that synergy going. The kids don't wanna blow it, so it moderates their behavior, they learn how to socialize out of their box, and then they get to go ski in one of the top resorts in the goddamn world!

There’s something to be said about the pragmatism of Snowy Claus. Rather than pretending that these classist undertones aren’t real he’s taking the honest approach, and from the looks of things,it works.
