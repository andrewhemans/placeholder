An insight on Dana Schutz’ exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston.

“Open Casket” (2006)  is a of depiction of [Emmett Till, the 14-year-old black boy who was abducted by two white men, brutally beaten, and murdered in Mississippi in 1955.](http://time.com/4008545/emmett-till-history/) But as I walked through galleries at the [Institute of Contemporary Art, in Boston,](https://www.icaboston.org/) I looked around and noticed the hyper-alert attendants. Most were white, wide-eyed, and dressed in black. A queer brown boy came and switched places with one of them, and as I approached a painting taller than myself, I heard him speaking on his radio. “Someone just left, and they were crying.” I looked at Roman, my curly-haired companion, incredulous. “Did you hear that?!” I said. Indifferent to the controversy, he laughed and confirmed what I’d heard. The tall painting, “Shame” (2017), still glistened. It was recently painted, almost wet, was it created after this year's [Whitney Biennial?](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2017Biennial)

 

Maybe you don’t know Dana Schutz, “Open Casket,” or the scandal surrounding it. [But like the majority of the artists shown at the Whitney,](https://hyperallergic.com/199215/breaking-down-the-demographics-of-the-new-whitney-museums-inaugural-exhibition/) Schutz is white. She grew up in a milky neighborhood near Detroit, earned her MFA from Columbia, and is now based in Brooklyn. What right does she have, to depict a broken, black body, to portray the unfathomable experience of blacks in America?

I wanted to understand why she painted Till. I read countless descriptions of her work and was bombarded with charged words—visceral, grotesque, raw. Till wasn’t the only black icon Schutz painted. The others were pop-stars, sensational interpretations of the black community. She portrayed Jay-Z in an elevator fight, and painted Michael Jackson on the autopsy table. Was Till an attempt to develop empathy, or was this all a stunt for attention, an easy way to further her career through black exploitation?

As I continued through the corridors, it became clearer what Schutz was about —Discomfort. I realized this staring at “Slow Motion Shower” (2015). But her work didn’t make me uncomfortable, it was more like I was just reading the word. And despite the rawness described by all the art critics, I only reacted to one work, “Smoking, Swimming, Crying” (2009). It was funny, in a terribly relatable, self-deprecating struggle kind of way.

I feel that struggle even while writing this. Who am I to speak on the effects of unwanted white contributions to the black narrative? I am somewhat versed in the art community, I understand oppression and representation as a minority, yet I am not black.

Dana Schutz was contributing to the narrative by representing a black person who was a victim of a hate crime; social representation and visual representation go hand in hand. Should Schutz use her platform to speak for an event she did not experience tied to a community she does not belong to? 

Even as a Mexican artist and an immigrant, I cannot speak for all Mexican artists, or all immigrants, or all women. I can only make work about my personal experience. I keep this line in my work to stay true to myself and not capitalize from others’ struggle.

I have a tremendous inclination to support disenfranchised and offended groups, rather than privileged, white painters. Earlier this year, I declined a studio visit as a form of low key resistance. The invited artist was white—an old, male abstract-painter, just like the other 84 percent of guest speakers at the [UC Davis Visiting Artist Lecture Series, since 2011. ](http://arts.ucdavis.edu/visiting-artist-lecture-series-previous-years)

Regardless of whether a minority group was in the wrong, by censoring artworks in a museum, I support them, hoping to ensure power structures move toward equality. After all, [museums don’t have the best record of just, cultural representation.](https://251d2191a60056d6ba74-1671eccf3a0275494885881efb0852a4.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/12223012_daily-links-guerrilla-girls-edition_td17aedb6.jpg)

There are a lot of stereotypes about what artists are. But we don’t have to elevate culture, better society or uphold morality. We don’t have to be social justice warriors. Take [Santiago Sierra](http://www.santiago-sierra.com/index_1024.php), who literally exploits people as an art form. He paid someone to masturbate inside of a cardboard box for 10 hours, and paid someone else to be trapped inside a gallery covered with  brick for almost two weeks. He paid poor women to stand facing a wall, and prostitutes to get a line tattooed on their back. Sierra is an exceptional artist, but not in a good versus evil way. It’s more crude, effective, and real. A visceral way to portray his concepts to the world.

Although I found the show compelling and left less apprehensive of her work, none of my questions about identity and representation were answered. I regret being caught up in it, rather than focusing on the wonderful curation in the surrounding galleries, an incredible array of artists of color like [Steve McQueen](http://www.thomasdanegallery.com/artists/45-steve-mcqueen/works/), the director of “12 Years a Slave,” and [Nari Ward](http://www.nariwardstudio.com/), who stole the show with [“Naturalization Drawing Table” (2004).](https://www.icaboston.org/events/nari-wards-naturalization-table)
