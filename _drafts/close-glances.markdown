**William Grubb** has been making photographs since 2007. With a background in photojournalism and creative writing he captures and creates intimate images of gesture and the human form. Conceptual portraiture, street photography and rugged landscapes of the Sierra Nevada dominate his visual work. Grubb is an analog photographer who processes and prints his film in a home darkroom at his Sacramento studio.

**Kevin Zee** is an artist from Sacramento / San Francisco Bay Area exploring audio and video manipulations since 2006. Since receiving his AA in audio production from American Rive College and BA in Video Production from SFSU Kevin has been exploring and expanding themes and concepts fit and not fit for audio/visual collaborations. An ever evolving theme can be seen with his work throughout the years in the realms of micro photography, videography, installations, watercolor paintings, audio, and laser cutting.
