**A Gilded Elsewhere**<br>

<div style="margin-left: 160px">
A hedge fund lobbies against a mid-size company.<br>
It wants more regulation to drive the stock price<br>
down. The hedge fund is selling it short<br>
and will score big if the stock slides.<br>
Meanwhile the mid-size company lays off<br>
thousands in what it calls a defensive measure.<br>
The company is fighting to keep its stock price high,<br>
but one rich man can smell a deal —<br>
when he sets the wheels in motion<br> 
those thousands of former employees<br>
are left high and dry. This is the soul<br>
of opportunity withering to appease<br>
the stock market gods. The leftovers<br>
are discarded so that the investor class<br>
is dutifully served. Then I meet<br>
the twenty-somethings who are trying<br>
to run and jump into the workforce.<br>
They're told they're not skilled enough.<br>
And they might not be, but even if they are,<br>
there are no assurances for them.<br>
They feel the burden of indebtedness<br>
settling on them; they want to know where<br>
to appeal for their shot at common dignity.<br>
The music plays faster and one by one<br>
the chairs are pulled away. Then it stops,<br>
and they scurry away to find a remaining seat.<br>
It's old school entertainment. Those<br> 
left standing wonder if they should dance<br>
the slow dance of redemption,<br> 
belly to belly with the magicians of finance,<br>
who are doling out marching orders to<br>
a gilded elsewhere. Hurry up! Skedaddle.<br>
There's no time to waste worrying if this<br>
market crusade will lead to anything good.<br>

**The Coffin**<br>

<div style="margin-left: 160px">
The ritual burial by jurisprudence<br>
begins during the process of jury selection<br>
where the letter of the law instructs<br>
the assembled to think narrowly,<br>
not to make cultural assumptions,<br>
to only consider the evidence.<br>
We come together around the body<br>
of the accused and pay our respects<br>
to a dark-skinned man charged with<br>
domestic violence, reported by the police<br>
and therefore obligated to go to trial.<br>
The prosecutor asks the members in<br>
the jury box if they can abide an unbiased<br>
judgment even though the aggrieved woman<br>
is no longer pressing charges; they have<br>
reconciled, and you see them together<br>
bearing no injuries a month after the fact<br>
outside the courtroom smiling at<br>
each other and embracing. You are waiting in<br>
the gallery hoping you will be called into<br>
the box, so you can ask the obvious<br>
question — why does this trial need<br>
to proceed. You want to bring up<br>
the possibility of prosecutorial overreach,<br>
whether the interests of the people<br>
of the State of California are really<br>
being served by turning this young man<br> 
into a felon, sending him into the system.<br>
And if you spoke up and separated<br> 
yourself from the calm, respectful<br>
and obedient members of the potential<br> 
jury, you'd be dismissed right after<br> 
the black man from New York City and<br>
as you'd leave frothing with indignation,<br>
parting with one more breach of protocol,<br>
you'd bid good luck to the defendant<br>
and urge all the onlookers in Dept. 28<br>
to have the moral courage, fellow<br> 
citizens, have the moral courage<br>
 . . . but if you'd done that, you'd have<br> 
already lost. The prosecutor would have<br>
played you off against your convictions,<br>
undermined your power to render<br> 
a meaningful decision, so you watch<br>
and listen without tipping your thinking<br>
because that's how you can matter<br>
in one man's life or maybe another's<br>
or maybe everyone's as we stand around<br>
politely talking until it is time for<br>
us to silently view the coffin.<br>
