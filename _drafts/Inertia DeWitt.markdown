The first time I saw American Wonder Woman was on a stage in the back of the Latino Cultural Center off Front Street. I was groggy after a long day of work, thinking a quick dip into some creative culture might revitalize my soul. 
Sitting on an overgrown lawn surrounded by mosquitos and friends, we all grew silent as a woman clad in her own hand-made Wonder Woman costume came to the stage. What followed was a wonderful mixture of activism and nostalgic accessibility through social history.

Interia DeWitt’s multidisciplinary, performance-art protest piece AMERICAN WONDER is a biting critique of what it means to be a 21st century American. While it may not sound so sweet, DeWitt’s delivery a crafted approach to mass distribution of her message. She covers classics like, American Woman by ___ and Material Girl by Gwen Stephani, but with careful listening, listeners can pick up on her empowering messages of ___ and ___. DeWitt uses nostalgic imagery and tunes to fully embody the Wonder Woman archetype, which to her means  positive feelings, warrior, femme, justice.  DeWitt believes we need to fight unchecked masculine energy to find the freedom and self determination we find ourselves losing day by day.

Her full feature work is a 37 minute long video composed of music videos, satirical commercials, and culminates in a powerful movement towards social consciousness and motivated collaborative action. After seeing her work it is hard to sit still, and not only because of the coordinated flash mob! A major questions DeWitt has been mulling over is “What does it mean to become a hero?” Her answer is not a simple one but through making a stance with your values and little things every day. What is it that you can do? and do little things to move that forward. From everyday social interactions to leading a march, what is your form of protest. 
What does it mean to become a hero?  It encourages audiences to become empowered by recognizing that the personal is political and that each of us are equipped with all of the tools we need to take action and be heroes in our everyday lives
