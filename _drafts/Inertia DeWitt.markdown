The first time I saw American Wonder Woman was on a stage in the back of the [Latino Center of Art and Culture](http://www.thelatinocenter.com/) off Front Street. I was groggy after a long day of work, thinking a quick dip into some creative culture might revitalize my soul. 
Sitting on an overgrown lawn surrounded by mosquitos and friends, we all grew silent as a woman clad in her own hand-made Wonder Woman costume came to the stage. What followed was a wonderful mixture of activism and throwbacks that asks us to look critically at our social history.

Interia DeWitt’s multidisciplinary, performance-art protest piece AMERICAN WONDER is a biting critique of what it means to be a 21st century American. While it may not sound so sweet, DeWitt’s delivery comes in the form of beloved pop songs, making the distribution of anarchist messages more palatable. She covers classics like [American Woman](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ry30gRy3O4) and [Material Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNSUOFgj97M), but with careful listening, listeners can pick up on her empowering messages of self-empowerment and the need for justice all while calling out bullshit along the way. DeWitt uses nostalgic imagery and tunes to fully embody the Wonder Woman archetype, which to her means being a femme justice warrior that channels positivity. DeWitt believes we need to fight unchecked masculine energy to find the freedom and self-determination we are losing day by day, and faster in the more recent political climate.

Her full feature work is 37 minute long and is composed of music videos, satirical commercials, culminating as a powerful gesture towards social consciousness and collaborative action. After seeing her work it is hard to sit still, and not only because of the epic flash mob! A major question DeWitt has been mulling over is “What does it mean to become a hero?” Her answer is not a simple one but she found that making a stance with your values and doing little acts of protest every day is a manageable and productive way to move our society forward. She prompts viewers to think about their skills and ability to apply them. From everyday social interactions as a barista to leading a march as a community organizer, what is your form of protest? Here is a preview reel of DeWitt’s video piece AMERICAN WONDER to give you a taste of what I’m talking about.
