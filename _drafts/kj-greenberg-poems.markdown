**Tending Her Rows of Perennials**

Within her mind, the librarian tended rows of perennials, aisles of memoirs.<br>
In her altered state, she never experienced sorrow, but faced equivocations.<br>
She knew that young, unctuous medicos compared unfavorably to many<br>
Supernumeraries that swept halls, emptied bedpans, distributed bromides.

Patient-centered imbroglio mostly proceeded without administrative correction.<br>
No verges gilded by fairies or visits to execrable glens altered her gelid reads.<br>
Falling plaster, exposing gaster-like brick beneath, belied odd Autumnal hues.<br>
Her ward’s lambent dams swarmed with vitreous minerals piled high by lamps.

Nonetheless, the bibliognost appreciated that Power Woman should endure<br>
Beyond Menopause, the Musical. The phlebologist and the night nurse both<br>
Hummed crazy, punk music, stuck psychedelic decals on her bedroom walls,<br>
Realizing that validity accepts explicitness among the best curative varieties.

Those caregivers’ attempts to change the status quo, notwithstanding elder abuse,<br>
Reigned along pockmarked corridors and in communal bathrooms. Orderlies got<br>
Blamed, but docs, quacks, and similar staff questioned nothing about their peers.<br>
Science’s whole approach of hypothesis-testing left guilty parties off the hook.

So, Granny gently accepted her work, shared some marketing tips, welcomed<br>
Systemic challenges to her twilight days and nights; she liberated companions<br>
From holding pens— until the hospital’s warden isolated her on the psych ward.<br>
There, bereft of sleep, her delamination, “among posies” was pharmaceutical.
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Omitting Sounds**

By omitting sounds, we impossibly catch sleeping weasels. Officious<br>
Sorts, those foulest curs, all brazen waist-coated, unctuous snoutbands,<br>
Press-stud experts at social media contravention, most caudal language<br>
Notwithstanding.

Seemingly, wherever bratty, little opponents join lumpen carryings-on,<br>
Ornery sorts, wicked mongrels incapable of articulating “zooterkins”<br>
Or “zounds” correctly, display buttocks, mock as British archers and<br>
Bite.

Perhaps, because their ontogeny’s misdirected, because they can’t cover<br>
Any distance between ideas and applications, such ruffians reject publicly<br>
Prescribed roles in favor of expressing their penetrating, noxious beliefs<br>
Forever.

To wit, a large per cent of compromised individuals, lame protests aside,<br>
Hold convictions based on shared macadams, cultural lubricants, palatial<br>
Highway bitumen, teacup pals, hereditary commands; lots they carelessly<br>
Consume.

Fumbling, on balance, issues invectives regarding grandsons guilty of<br>
Relieving themselves on buildings, of ignoring plumbing’s good worth.<br>
Elsewise, atrocities, penological tests, celestial effulgence, get ignored.<br>
Mislaid.
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Things that Chew**

We can enhance failing when we ignore stroppy associates,<br>
Perhaps, even tell licentious genera to naff off, or, to scoot.<br>
Short of immolating human extras, we might clean up most<br>
Main Streets, side roads, alleys and some mixed, dirt paths.

It’s the things that chew, though, those critters that seem<br>
Culpable for wolfing kids’ watercolors, gargling saints’<br> 
Sonatas, likewise taking big bites from homemade pasta,<br>
Who burp freelanced tubas, drum sets, and new knitwear.

No matter their leaders’ rhetoric, those beasts get faulted,<br>
’cause our population lacks moral fortitude in small rooms,<br>
Can’t be counted on to respond lawfully to baleful antics,<br>
Lack ready answers, spread disease, cause wrongful deaths.

On balance, no tarantula ever truly victimized the elderly.<br>
Few enough harpies stay around to pick off sickly sailors.<br>
It’s likewise doubtful nightmares made of mattocks, shivs<br>
Might sodden us like acid rain, toilet tissue-decked shoes.

Even entire remudas of frowsy unicorns can’t obstruct when<br>
Packed souls, minus much viscera, splayed on alien travoises,<br>
Get neglected. No natural dogs drag those poles, haul goods<br>
Left to rot during liminality or other sort of kindred phases.

Accordingly, odd cavalcades sometimes march by forests,<br>
Umlands, fueled, maybe, by subconscious wishes to bring<br>
Old plights beyond public foreclosure, to force propinquity.<br>
Our mindless masses, also scholars, chuckle until gagging.
 
See, slogging avidity dispels indifference, makes us silly,<br>
Like pointing to dead lizards, dented pots, one-off songs,<br>
Also, keychain forbs used to activate squash-head bombs,<br>
Plus backordered Komodo brooders, including their poison.

We oughtn’t communicate with neighbors in quest of our<br>
Annihilation, or possessed of sufficient energy to power<br>
Overweening hegemonies. Elsewise, it’s fine to encourage<br>
Weird development, mainly of all denumerable, hairy toes.<br>
