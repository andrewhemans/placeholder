Tending Her Rows of Perennials
Within her mind, the librarian tended rows of perennials, aisles of memoirs.
In her altered state, she never experienced sorrow, but faced equivocations.
She knew that young, unctuous medicos compared unfavorably to many
Supernumeraries that swept halls, emptied bedpans, distributed bromides.
Patient-centered imbroglio mostly proceeded without administrative correction.
No verges gilded by fairies or visits to execrable glens altered her gelid reads.
Falling plaster, exposing gaster-like brick beneath, belied odd Autumnal hues.
Her ward’s lambent dams swarmed with vitreous minerals piled high by lamps.
Nonetheless, the bibliognost appreciated that Power Woman should endure
Beyond Menopause, the Musical. The phlebologist and the night nurse both
Hummed crazy, punk music, stuck psychedelic decals on her bedroom walls, 
Realizing that validity accepts explicitness among the best curative varieties.
Those caregivers’ attempts to change the status quo, notwithstanding elder abuse,
Reigned along pockmarked corridors and in communal bathrooms. Orderlies got
Blamed, but docs, quacks, and similar staff questioned nothing about their peers.
Science’s whole approach of hypothesis-testing left guilty parties off the hook.
So, Granny gently accepted her work, shared some marketing tips, welcomed 
Systemic challenges to her twilight days and nights; she liberated companions
From holding pens— until the hospital’s warden isolated her on the psych ward.  
There, bereft of sleep, her delamination, “among posies” was pharmaceutical.
Omitting Sounds
By omitting sounds, we impossibly catch sleeping weasels. Officious
Sorts, those foulest curs, all brazen waist-coated, unctuous snoutbands,
Press-stud experts at social media contravention, most caudal language
Notwithstanding.
Seemingly, wherever bratty, little opponents join lumpen carryings-on, 
Ornery sorts, wicked mongrels incapable of articulating “zooterkins” 
Or “zounds” correctly, display buttocks, mock as British archers and
Bite.
Perhaps, because their ontogeny’s misdirected, because they can’t cover
Any distance between ideas and applications, such ruffians reject publicly
Prescribed roles in favor of expressing their penetrating, noxious beliefs
Forever.
To wit, a large per cent of compromised individuals, lame protests aside, 
Hold convictions based on shared macadams, cultural lubricants, palatial 
Highway bitumen, teacup pals, hereditary commands; lots they carelessly
Consume.
Fumbling, on balance, issues invectives regarding grandsons guilty of 
Relieving themselves on buildings, of ignoring plumbing’s good worth.
Elsewise, atrocities, penological tests, celestial effulgence, get ignored.
Mislaid.

Things that Chew
We can enhance failing when we ignore stroppy associates,
Perhaps, even tell licentious genera to naff off, or, to scoot.
Short of immolating human extras, we might clean up most
Main Streets, side roads, alleys and some mixed, dirt paths.
It’s the things that chew, though, those critters that seem 
Culpable for wolfing kids’ watercolors, gargling saints’ 
Sonatas, likewise taking big bites from homemade pasta,
Who burp freelanced tubas, drum sets, and new knitwear.
No matter their leaders’ rhetoric, those beasts get faulted,
‘cause our population lacks moral fortitude in small rooms, 
Can’t be counted on to respond lawfully to baleful antics, 
Lack ready answers, spread disease, cause wrongful deaths.
On balance, no tarantula ever truly victimized the elderly.
Few enough harpies stay around to pick off sickly sailors. 
It’s likewise doubtful nightmares made of mattocks, shivs
Might sodden us like acid rain, toilet tissue-decked shoes.
Even entire remudas of frowsy unicorns can’t obstruct when
Packed souls, minus much viscera, splayed on alien travoises,
Get neglected. No natural dogs drag those poles, haul goods
Left to rot during liminality or other sort of kindred phases.
Accordingly, odd cavalcades sometimes march by forests, 
Umlands, fueled, maybe, by subconscious wishes to bring
Old plights beyond public foreclosure, to force propinquity.
Our mindless masses, also scholars, chuckle until gagging.
 
See, slogging avidity dispels indifference, makes us silly,
Like pointing to dead lizards, dented pots, one-off songs,
Also, keychain forbs used to activate squash-head bombs, 
Plus backordered Komodo brooders, including their poison. 
We oughtn’t communicate with neighbors in quest of our
Annihilation, or possessed of sufficient energy to power 
Overweening hegemonies. Elsewise, it’s fine to encourage 
Weird development, mainly of all denumerable, hairy toes.
