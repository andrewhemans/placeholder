Sticky sweet summertime possibility intersected by entanglement in a web of molasses. The multimedia work of Franceska Gamez drips into infinity through a personal lens.

Her mesmerizing sculptures combine repetitive textures with motifs of the psyche to expand in the realm of consciousness. Delicate petals and insect wings painted in light tones are uplifting and trancelike. Otherworldly imagery overlaid and organized within shadowbox frames focus the viewer’s gaze, like a portal these works take viewers into an introspective moment.

Working meticulously, her linework intermingles and adorns her subjects - hinting at a complexity not quite defined yet all too real to ignore. A tousled mind baking in the summer sun, mulling over deep thoughts that viewers can define for themselves with the given ambiguity of the work.

Gamez takes the position of open mediator between the viewer and their own thoughts. While the work holds a therapeutic purpose for the artist herself, it is abstracted enough that viewers can become immersed in themselves through reflecting on her work. Especially with her anthropomorphic work, one may enter the work through aesthetic admiration, but at some point, the process of viewing turns into almost like looking in a mirror and moments recognizing the cogs of the mind reveal themselves.

Extending her multimedia hand, Gamez has also produced murals and installations. Her expression is not limited as it expresses limitlessness with swirling lines that encompass viewers transcending reality with her light floating colors. To see her in action, look out for Gamez working with the [Asian American Women Artists Association](http://aawaa.net/) in the Richmond District of San Francisco. Along with the Mural Muses, she will be painting a mural over the summer, more details forthcoming on their [Indigogo page](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-first-mural-for-asian-american-women-artists#/).
