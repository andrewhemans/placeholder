author-bio: F.I. Goldhaber's words capture people, places, and events with a photographer's
  eye and a poet's soul. As a reporter, editor, business writer, and marketing communications
  consultant, she produced news stories, feature articles, editorial columns, and
  reviews for newspapers, corporations, governments, and non-profits in five states.
  Now her poetry, fiction, and essays appear in paper, electronic, and audio magazines,
  books, newspapers, calendars, anthologies, and street signs.  Her fourth collection,
  "Food ? Family ? Friends" explores how those three things send us feasting, flinching,
  and/or frolicking through life.

**Braving a Hostile World**

Your hands trembled as you handed me<br> 
the piece of paper, with a recent<br> 
date, explaining why your state ID<br> 
incorrectly said you were male. My<br> 
heart ached for you, in your late fifties,<br> 
finally able to come to terms<br>
with who you are in the face of a<br> 
hostile world. How brave not to let that<br> 
condescending letter stop you from<br>
enjoying an afternoon sailing,<br>
despite security theater<br>
forcing you to reveal personal<br>
conflicts to a complete stranger. I<br>
read the letter, even though I knew<br>
what it said, to honor your struggle,<br>
knowing how you must have debated<br>
whether to forfeit your afternoon<br> 
adventure rather than share it. But<br> 
I shushed your whispered explanation,<br> 
assuring you I understood. I<br>
took extra care with your paperwork,<br>
so there would be no chance you would have<br>
to extricate that missive from your<br>
pocketbook again. Handing it back,<br>
I complimented your stylish suit,<br> 
acknowledging the effort you had<br>
put into your appearance on this<br>
special day, and wished you bon voyage.<br>
I was grateful you lucked upon my<br>
post, rather than the volunteer at<br>
the next table, with the two-inch cross<br>
hanging from a chain around his neck,<br> 
and hoped the sailors would treat you as<br>
kindly as they did any of the other<br>
older ladies who came aboard. As<br>
the world has changed in the decade since, I<br>
occasionally wonder how it<br>
has treated you. Did your family<br>
accept you or turn you away? Did<br>
you keep the job that allowed you to<br>
purchase an elegant new wardrobe?<br>
Have you taken time, now and then, to<br>
have fun, to indulge in a few hours<br>
pleasant diversion, perhaps on a<br>
ship sailing across Commencement Bay?<br>
<br>

**Hate Speech ≠ Free Speech**

Hate speech is not free speech when it drowns<br>
out the voices of others; when it's<br>
used to harass those with darker skin;<br>
when it incites violence, murder.<br>

I'd abandoned your institution<br>
long ago, because you were always<br>
so eager to defend nazis' and<br>
white supremacists' right to free speech.<br>

Your organization ignores the<br>
impact of white privilege on the<br>
conversation; trauma inflicted<br>
on POC targets of hatred.<br>

But after the election when you<br>
jumped to fight for immigrants, and geared<br>
up to oppose the tyrant in the<br>
White House, I forgave past transgressions.<br>

My mistake. For only weeks after<br>
I rejoined, you again defended<br>
the indefensible — the "right" to<br>
incite violence with hate speech.<br>

Just nine days after, one of their own<br>
slaughtered two men and wounded a third,<br>
because they dared to stand between him<br>
and the recipients of his hate.<br>

You stood up to fortify fascist<br>
falsehoods, sanctioning the lie that their<br>
rally had anything to do with<br>
"free speech," when it was all about hate.<br>

Now, you have more blood on your hands, for<br>
enabling a rally that turned deadly,<br>
defending nazis' "rights" to hold a<br>
city hostage, attack its people.<br>

Will you send representatives to<br>
funerals, compensate families?<br>
Or will you ignore the hateful truth<br>
until the Gestapo comes for you?<br>
<br>
<br>

**Lessons from Martin Niemöller**

*Epigraph:*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Because I was not a Socialist."*

Thousands of unarmed, dark-skinned men shot by police.<br>
You've done nothing, your skin is white.<br>

Hundreds of mentally ill of all colors killed.<br>
You've done nothing, your mind is clear.<br>

Police murdered a white woman who called for help.<br>
You'll do nothing, she's Australian.<br>

We demanded police wear body cameras<br> 
and paid millions to purchase them.<br>

But those cameras always seem to "malfunction"<br>
when the truth is inconvenient.<br>

Officer Friendly has disappeared, replaced by<br>
urban soldiers equipped for war.<br>

When all those in uniform are hammers,<br>
the rest of us look just like nails.<br>

You ignored the lessons of history, voted<br>
for a madman's fascist regime.<br>

You chose white supremacy, rather than accept<br>
cultural change, social progress.<br>

You've remained silent or excused the attacks. What<br>
will you do when they come for you?<br>
