author-bio: F.I. Goldhaber's words capture people, places, and events with a photographer's
  eye and a poet's soul. As a reporter, editor, business writer, and marketing communications
  consultant, she produced news stories, feature articles, editorial columns, and

  Food ? Family ? Friends explores how those three things send us feasting, flinching,
  and/or frolicking through life.

Braving a Hostile World

Your hands trembled as you handed me 
the piece of paper, with a recent 
date, explaining why your state ID 
incorrectly said you were male. My 
heart ached for you, in your late fifties, 
finally able to come to terms 
with who you are in the face of a 
hostile world. How brave not to let that 
condescending letter stop you from 
enjoying an afternoon sailing, 
despite security theater 
forcing you to reveal personal 
conflicts to a complete stranger. I 
read the letter, even though I knew 
what it said, to honor your struggle, 
knowing how you must have debated 
whether to forfeit your afternoon 
adventure rather than share it. But 
I shushed your whispered explanation, 
assuring you I understood. I 
took extra care with your paperwork, 
so there would be no chance you would have 
to extricate that missive from your 
pocketbook again. Handing it back, 
I complimented your stylish suit, 
acknowledging the effort you had 
put into your appearance on this 
special day, and wished you bon voyage. 
I was grateful you lucked upon my 
post, rather than the volunteer at 
the next table, with the two-inch cross 
hanging from a chain around his neck, 
and hoped the sailors would treat you as 
kindly as they did any of the other 
older ladies who came aboard. As 
the world has changed in the decade since, I 
occasionally wonder how it 
has treated you. Did your family 
accept you or turn you away? Did
you keep the job that allowed you to
purchase an elegant new wardrobe?
Have you taken time, now and then, to 
have fun, to indulge in a few hours
pleasant diversion, perhaps on a 
ship sailing across Commencement Bay?


Hate Speech ≠ Free Speech

Hate speech is not free speech when it drowns 
out the voices of others; when it's 
used to harass those with darker skin;
when it incites violence, murder. 

I'd abandoned your institution 
long ago, because you were always
so eager to defend nazis' and
white supremacists' right to free speech.

Your organization ignores the 
impact of white privilege on the 
conversation; trauma inflicted
on POC targets of hatred.

But after the election when you 
jumped to fight for immigrants, and geared
up to oppose the tyrant in the 
White House, I forgave past transgressions. 

My mistake. For only weeks after 
I rejoined, you again defended 
the indefensible — the "right" to 
incite violence with hate speech.

Just nine days after, one of their own 
slaughtered two men and wounded a third,
because they dared to stand between him 
and the recipients of his hate.

You stood up to fortify fascist
falsehoods, sanctioning the lie that their
rally had anything to do with 
"free speech," when it was all about hate.

Now, you have more blood on your hands, for
enabling a rally that turned deadly, 
defending nazis' "rights" to hold a
city hostage, attack its people.

Will you send representatives to 
funerals, compensate families?
Or will you ignore the hateful truth
until the Gestapo comes for you?



Lessons from Martin Niemöller

Epigraph: 
	"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
	Because I was not a Socialist."

Thousands of unarmed, dark-skinned men shot by police.
You've done nothing, your skin is white.

Hundreds of mentally ill of all colors killed.
You've done nothing, your mind is clear.

Police murdered a white woman who called for help.
You'll do nothing, she's Australian.

We demanded police wear body cameras 
and paid millions to purchase them.

But those cameras always seem to "malfunction"
when the truth is inconvenient.

Officer Friendly has disappeared, replaced by 
urban soldiers equipped for war.

When all those in uniform are hammers, 
the rest of us look just like nails.

You ignored the lessons of history, voted 
for a madman's fascist regime.

You chose white supremacy, rather than accept
cultural change, social progress.

You've remained silent or excused the attacks. What
will you do when they come for you?
