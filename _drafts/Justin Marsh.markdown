Growing up in Lodi, California afforded Justin Marsh an opportunity to become acquainted with disintegration. That and his “grappling with trauma at a young age, [he] found that the development of [his] work is informed by characteristics of failure and collapse.”

Justin’s work skirts the line between photorealism and surrealism. Through using warm murky tones, he animates forgotten relics in a way that realizes their place and value on this earth. He plucks objects from reality and blends them in his memory-drenched visions giving them a new life that celebrates their beauty. In Justin’s words, “I intend to capture loss and imbue it with, what I believe to be, it’s inherent beauty.”
