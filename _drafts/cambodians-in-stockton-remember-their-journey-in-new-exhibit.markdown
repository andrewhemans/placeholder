During a fundraiser in September, I got to talking with a reporter from Stockton’s largest newspaper. “Stockton is a majority-minority community,” I said with a sense of pride. After all, the number of people of color in Stockton went from 30% to nearly 65% in 30 years. “Stockton is a plurality, not a majority-minority community,” he replied. I think we both had too much to drink, because a community can be both, but one thing is for certain, Stockton is diverse.

The fundraiser event was BREAD, hosted by Placeholder Magazine at a warehouse-turned furniture studio. The fundraiser was also a mini-grant program, where the ticket sales ($1,000) went to a community arts project presented by artists or organizations. This year’s winner was The Cambodian Experience: Our Journey to America Exhibit.

The Exhibit highlights the great  influx of Cambodian refugees who arrived to the United States due to the mass genocide that took place in Cambodia between 1975-1979. Many of which found a home in Stockton. Today, there are over 10,000 Cambodians living in Stockton. 

The Cambodian Experience is an exhibit by United Cambodian-American Network (UCAN) and its purpose is to raise awareness, educate, and revive the Cambodian-American history and culture. Through multiple galleries, the exhibit will showcase the cultural music, dance, and theater forms of the Cambodian people. There will also be a gallery dedicated to the people whose lives were lost in the Cambodian Genocide. 

The Cambodian Experience: Our Journey to America is FREE and open to the public. Opens December 16th at the San Joaquin County Office of Education and will run until December 22nd.
