Sarah Marie Hawkins is a Sacramento-based artist, professional photographer, and founder of Menagerie, an organization created to promote budding local artists. 

I met Sarah at Outlet Co-working for a conversation about her photography installation, "Faceless," for the temporary exhibition *Art Street*, which runs February 3rd to February 25th, at 300 First Avenue in Sacramento.

**Aida: How do you describe the subject matter or content of your work?**

**Sarah:** My work has always centered on women and what it is to be a woman. My past show, "2,500 Minutes," was comprised of illustrations of women in everyday poses. In each image their faces were obscured or parts of them were missing to visually represent how a society tends to take us apart. 

"2,500 Minutes" was not intended to be a slap-in-the-face project; it was a reminder to myself. In the past, I caught myself looking down on female friends and colleagues who gave up their work to become a mother or get married. That was a big part of their goal, and they were wonderful and strong people, but because it differed with mine, I judged it. 

"In Faceless," my illustrations are brought to life through photography.
