For those of us who are transplants, wanderers, or world travelers, we crave the comforts of home. Some may long for bike rides through childhood neighborhoods or lunch at high school haunts. But what do we do when those comforts and subtle reminders of the past are stolen from us? What happens when the places that hold the most meaning to us silently slip into a city’s history, where empty buildings serve solely as a tangible memory? Unfortunately, for many of us from Stockton, beloved cold concrete establishments stand empty as the din of dishes, clattering cups, and snip of scissors recedes as stillness takes their place.
 
On June 7, 2017, community staples were shuttered along Stockton’s Miracle Mile, a strip of shops and restaurants along Pacific Avenue. Some of the affected places include Casa Flores Restaurant, Centrale Kitchen & Bar, a beauty parlor and Empresso Coffeehouse, formerly known as Empire Theater. If social media is any indication as to how people are feeling about this recent news, people are extremely saddened by the loss of the original Empresso.Their caffeinated concoctions surpassed those of any other shop in town.
 
However, as an Oakland resident who lost friends and classmates in the Ghost Ship fire this past December, I am experiencing conflicting feelings. In Stockton, building owner Christopher “Kitt” Bennitt put workers’ and patrons’ lives in danger. One violation in particular is listed multiple times in the [cease and desist order](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ZOiXG9tKc2a0VwdUdhXzlkNFU/view): “There are multiple extension cords being used as permanent sources of electrical installation…Many of the extension cords are damaged and deteriorated, presenting an even high risk of fire.”
 
This violation echoes one of the suspected causes of the [Ghost Ship fire](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/02/oakland-ghost-ship-warehouse-fire-aftermath-artists) that consumed 36 lives: overloading outlets with extension cords connected to high voltage equipment.
 
Bennitt was notified over the course of five years that changes were required, or else the building—and the businesses within it—would be rendered unusable. As the list of repairs grew into an untamable beast, a community suffered the repercussions.
 
We need to learn the lessons from events that came before and understand the reasoning for why these regulations are in place. Even the most incredible chai tea lattes, shows or chile rellenos are not worth risking a friend’s life.
 
When and where do we draw the line between nostalgia and safety?
 
Hear me out: I am a child of the Mile who swept shop floors and tap danced along Pacific with Hot Shoe Dance Company. Hell, I even saw the first Harry Potter film at Empire Theater; I will never forget the way my grandma laughed at me when I yelped at that part with [the screaming book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj-rpslBk0c). My mom had her first taste of refried beans as a baby at the Casa Flores on the Mile. Despite the wonderful memories and a home-style helping of nostalgia, a community can now move forward to create for the future.
 
Here’s to hoping that the individuals and businesses who rely on these spaces are able to receive the help that they need in getting back on their feet and building something better—and safer.
