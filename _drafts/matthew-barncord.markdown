*Hypnagogia*, 2015
Digital photographs and inkjet prints

Hypnagogia is the experience of the transitional state from wakefulness to sleep:the hypnagogic state of consciousness, during the onset of sleep. Mental phenomena that occur during this &quot;threshold consciousness&quot; phase include lucid thought, lucid dreaming, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. 

Hypnagogia is part of a series of photographic works in which I explore the interstices between American rural development and suburban or urban development.

One of the things that occurs to me about these meetings is the recurrence of manifest destiny, once directional from East to West, now radiating from urban centers outward. There’s no question whether to expand, only how. During this new phase, an even more radical transformation of the landscape created during the previous manifest is happening as the Anthropocene is in full swing. The rapidness of this change is the most radical geographical shift to occur in North America since the initial displacement of the continent’s natives, yet it has hardly been recorded in contemporary visual dialog.

In this body of work and related projects I try to come to terms with this transition on an emotional and aesthetic level specifically focused on the physical line where it occurs and the liminal experience of passing from one world and one time to the next.

*Nothing forces anyone to enjoy except the superego. The superego is the imperative of jouissance – 

Enjoy!

Jacques Lacan*

Is there anything more stressful than a good time? Whether going out on a Saturday night or touring a foreign shore, it’s not enough to have the experience which you know is enriching, you are expected to like it. You HAVE to enjoy it. What pictures will you take? What stories will you tell? You’d better prove you had fun. Obviously, though we know it is good for us to do it, doing something outside of the comfortable situation we’ve spent years cultivating is going to be stressful. However, we make the effort to enjoy these uncomfortable situations, unsatisfied until we enjoy the discomfort, transcend it, and the joy is palpably painful.

The horizontal human body represents its capacity for repose and reception. The pool raft, an objective compliment of that representation, is here erected towards the vertical. It is not brought fully to the static and confident state of verticality, but hovers in a skewed and anxious position where it is neither rising nor falling. In the pool the raft drifts freely, touched by wind and free from friction, but in the frame it is contained and its movements are predictable. The raft has its place in the sun, so I have given it the sun.

Well, artificial sun, which will do. The entire fantasy is safely anchored to the electrical grid which provides its light so escape is impossible. Good honest leisure. Have Fun!

*personal injury object,* 2016
Steel, rubber, electrical cord, and paint

Whose responsibility is safety? It seems that it is anyone’s but our own as people constantly look to blame an administrator, an organization or society itself for every injury and mishap that occurs. The expectation is that it is someone’s job to ensure our safety and wellbeing. It is someone’s responsibility to look after the world and make damned sure there are no sharp edges, no tripping hazards, nothing injuriously unexpected. It is always someone’s responsibility, but never ours.

The least safe situation imaginable is the one in which we expect our safety to be handled. The least responsible thing we can do for others is to presume to act on behalf of their safety, because what we really do is rob them of their own responsibility.

The medium I have chosen to utilize for this work, beyond its materials, is the language of systematic safety and the improper use of that language’s syntax. The materials are recognizable, even banal, but they are steeped in a system of codes of safety that often go unrecognized. There are literally laws for how these materials must exist and interact in the world so that we don’t have to think about them. By using these materials removed from their coded system of safety I hope to make clear the independence that things and the use of those things have from the systems, such as safety codes, that we assign to them. At the same time, I hope to clarify that safety is not inherent and is, in all ways that matter, our own responsibility.
