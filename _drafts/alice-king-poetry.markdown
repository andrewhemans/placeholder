Raft

I listen to the sounds 
I hear words in the long silences
That stretch and quiver between heartbeats —
Anyone can write anything down and call it poetry
You can say any combination of words you like
And it may still be poetry
Caught in the silence, caught in the words
Tangled in the spaces we always ignore
You're lost for words again
But they tumble from you
Faster, like rapids crashing and churning and rippling and growling around a white water raft 
They threw the ropes for you, when they thought you'd go overboard 
But miraculously you don't
And no one can figure out how.


































Memory

She smiled her cool smile
Gold tooth flickering like a beacon
Hair wild and raving 
She said, "How you doing?"
She said, "I got a man in my heart."
She said, "You got a man in your heart?"
And I thought about you.
Without thinking
Jaw strained with reserve
Memories spring out of the pandora box
I can't remember—
But I can.
This woman got a sweet touch
Wild hair and all
Her eyes remind me of chocolate
Her eyes look like mirrors 
And I want to let my heart bleed
All over her clothes
So she won't forget either.

















They

They love colors
Blue pink red purple
Sunset colors, mashing colors
Colors that fade and blend and fade again
Crazy lipstick colors
Dazzling his face 
Brightening quiet, angry eyes
They are “they”
Not “he”
“She”
“It”
It, like an inhuman being
An alien to the world beyond his threshold
He remembers
Nestled in his mind are the bruises
Abrasions
Scraped knees and a sore head
