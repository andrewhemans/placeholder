**Raft**<br>

I listen to the sounds<br>
I hear words in the long silences<br>
That stretch and quiver between heartbeats —<br>
Anyone can write anything down and call it poetry<br>
You can say any combination of words you like<br>
And it may still be poetry<br>
Caught in the silence, caught in the words<br>
Tangled in the spaces we always ignore<br>
You're lost for words again<br>
But they tumble from you<br>
Faster, like rapids crashing and churning and rippling and<br>
growling around a white water raft<br>
They threw the ropes for you, when they thought you'd go overboard<br> 
But miraculously you don't<br>
And no one can figure out how.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Memory**<br>

She smiled her cool smile<br>
Gold tooth flickering like a beacon<br>
Hair wild and raving<br>
She said, "How you doing?"<br>
She said, "I got a man in my heart."<br>
She said, "You got a man in your heart?"<br>
And I thought about you.<br>
Without thinking<br>
Jaw strained with reserve<br>
Memories spring out of the pandora box<br>
I can't remember—<br>
But I can.<br>
This woman got a sweet touch<br>
Wild hair and all<br>
Her eyes remind me of chocolate<br>
Her eyes look like mirrors<br>
And I want to let my heart bleed<br>
All over her clothes<br>
So she won't forget either.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

**They**<br>

They love colors<br>
Blue pink red purple<br>
Sunset colors, mashing colors<br>
Colors that fade and blend and fade again<br>
Crazy lipstick colors<br>
Dazzling his face<br>
Brightening quiet, angry eyes<br>
They are “they”<br>
Not “he”<br>
“She”<br>
“It”<br>
It, like an inhuman being<br>
An alien to the world beyond his threshold<br>
He remembers<br>
Nestled in his mind are the bruises<br>
Abrasions<br>
Scraped knees and a sore head<br>
<br>
<br>
