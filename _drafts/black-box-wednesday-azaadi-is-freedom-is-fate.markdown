Azaadi Is Freedom Is Fate* is the new music video by *Kohinoorgasm (one word: ko-hee-noor-gasm)* the experimental pop music project of Josephine Shetty. As a mixed race, queer, desi artist, she seeks to expand the dialogue around multidimensional identity-based experiences by visualizing and performing commentary on complex histories across many mediums, including photography, journalism, music, and modeling. Josephine is from Los Angeles, CA, and now resides in the San Francisco Bay Area.
